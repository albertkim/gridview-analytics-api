That is why we are working in partnership to ensure homes are built for people in the communities they call home.”A total of 15 new projects in the Interior and northern B.C. have been selected through the third intake of the Building BC: Community Housing Fund (CHF). These proposed projects will provide a total of 584 affordable rental homes for individuals, families, seniors, people living with disabilities and Indigenous people in B.C.The announcement took place at South Skaha Place, 5081 8th Ave. in Okanagan Falls, which is a housing project operated by the South Skaha Housing Society. The site previously received provincial funding in 2018 and provides 26 affordable homes for seniors in the community. As one of the successful proponents of the 2023 CHF call for proposals, the society will receive CHF funding to build additional housing on site.“I am pleased to express my gratitude for the opportunity that BC Housing has bestowed upon the small town of Okanagan Falls,” said Michael Livingstone, board chair, South Skaha Housing Society. “The addition of a 36-unit housing complex is a welcome development, particularly in light of the pressing need for housing in our community.”Including these projects, the Province, through BC Housing, has identified more than 40 new projects to move forward, totalling approximately 3,500 affordable rental homes. Projects have also recently been announced in Metro Vancouver and on Vancouver Island. More projects for the Interior region will be announced later. This brings the total to 12,500 affordable rental homes already open or underway through the CHF program since its launch in 2018.“Okanagan Falls is a growing community and the addition of more housing will support the influx of new residents to our area,” said Roderick Rose, a tenant in South Skaha Place. “The society, in my opinion, is on the right track by building new and modern places to live. Thanks to the society and its vision, this can only be a plus to the area.”The Community Housing Fund is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government.

This life-changing action for British Columbians wouldn't be possible without the dedicated support and community leadership of the partners in these communities, so I'm grateful for what they do for so many. The homes help make sure our communities can live up to their full potential, unlocking more doors for workers, seniors, young families and more.”Mark Pendergraft, board chair, Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen —“Creating more affordable housing options is a growing social and economic issue throughout the regional district and this project is an important step in the right direction.”Jill Atkey, CEO, BC Non-Profit Housing Association —“The rental housing crisis touches every corner of British Columbia, and we’re thrilled to see non-profits in the Interior and northern regions will soon be constructing hundreds of new affordable rental homes. These homes are critical for British Columbians experiencing affordability challenges today, but importantly, they will also be home to thousands more in the generations to come. But our work is not done, and we will continue to push every government to increase investment into safe, secure and affordable housing.”Quick Facts:\n\tThe CHF is a $3.3-billion investment that targets to build more than 20,000 affordable rental homes for people with moderate- and low-income households by 2031-32.\n\tBC Housing is supporting non-profit housing providers to prepare for future CHF funding calls, with the next call expected in late 2024 or early 2025.\n\tUnder the CHF program, residents of 70% of the units pay rent geared to income, where rent is generally based on 30% of household income.\n\t\tThis includes 20% of units for residents with very low incomes, such as those receiving income or disability assistance.\n\t\n\tThe remaining 30% of units are available at or below market rents for households with moderate incomes.\nLearn More:To learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/A backgrounder follows.Interior: 13 projects – 539 homes\n\tAshcroft, 710 Elm St.: 29 homes for seniors, in partnership with Thompson View Manor Society.\n\tCastlegar, 925 Columbia Ave.: 68 homes for families, seniors and people living with disabilities, in partnership with Lu'ma Native Housing Society.\n\tChase, 221 Shepherd Rd.: 37 homes for seniors and people living with disabilities, in partnership with Oncore Seniors Society.\n\tCreston (undisclosed address for safety reasons): 18 homes for families, young adults, people living with disabilities and women and children, in partnership with Creston Valley Community Housing Society.\n\tGolden, 525-527 9th Ave. North: 27 homes for families and people living with disabilities, in partnership with Golden Community Economic Development Society.\n\tKelowna, 1951 Cross Rd.: 68 homes for families, seniors and people living with disabilities, in partnership with Turning Points Collaborative Society.\n\tKeremeos, 724 Veterans Ave.: 24 homes for families, women, young adults, seniors and people living with disabilities, in partnership with Lower Similkameen Community Services Society.\n\tOkanagan Falls, 5081B 8th Ave.: 36 homes for families and people in the workforce, in partnership with South Skaha Housing Society\n\tPrinceton, (undisclosed address for safety reasons): 29 homes for women, in partnership with Princeton & District Community Services Society.\n\tSalmon Arm, 1141 18 St. N.E.: 40 homes for families, seniors and people living with disabilities, in partnership with Canadian Mental Health Association - Shuswap/Revelstoke.\n\tSparwood, 441 Pine Ave.: 32 homes for individuals, single women with children and people living with disabilities, in partnership with Elk Valley Family Society.\n\tSummerland, 13609 Dickson Ave.: 90 homes for seniors and people living with disabilities, in partnership with Parkdale Place Housing Society.\n\tTrail, 1955 Seventh Ave.: 41 homes for seniors, in partnership with Trail and District Senior Citizens' Villa Society.\nNorth: two projects – 45 homes\n\tHaida Gwaii, 609 2nd Ave. Daajing Giids: 17 homes for families, seniors and people living with disabilities, in partnership with Daajing Giids Heritage Housing Society.\n\tVanderhoof, 2824 Burrard Ave.: 28 homes for families, seniors and people living with disabilities, in partnership with Nechako View Senior Citizens’ Home Society.\nTotal: 15 projects – 584 homes",

    "contents": "RICHMOND – A partnership aimed at fighting pollution in the aviation sector, growing investment and supporting clean, sustainable jobs and business opportunities for people in British Columbia has been made between the B.C. government and Vancouver International Airport (YVR).“Vancouver’s airport is one of our province’s biggest employers and economic drivers of growth and revenue. They’re also leaders in sustainability and innovation,” said Premier David Eby. “By working together on shared priorities, like promoting made-in-B.C. clean tech and expanding trade diversification while reducing pollution, we can maximize benefits for all British Columbians, while strengthening our province’s economic future.”Through a signed memorandum of understanding (MOU), YVR and the Province will collaborate with Indigenous partners, communities and aviation and aerospace stakeholders over three years to deliver new products, projects and activities that reflect the following shared priorities to:\n\taccelerate sustainable aviation to fight pollution and reduce emissions;\n\tsupport community resilience, leveraging YVR’s expertise to support communities in emergency preparedness, response and recovery;\n\tincrease clean-tech investment to promote made-in-B.C. technology and good jobs;\n\texpand trade diversification, working to meet increased demand for B.C. export and grow B.C. tourism and good jobs for people;\n\tpromote workforce development growth to meet demand for skilled workers in aerospace and aviation; and\n\tenhance goods and people movement, positioning YVR as a key hub within a multi-modal hub for people and goods movement between communities throughout B.C.  \n“This partnership recognizes the important role that YVR and B.C.’s aviation sector play in the diversification of the provincial economy, including zero-carbon innovation, technology, international trade and investment, and skills training,” said Tamara Vrooman, president and CEO, Vancouver International Airport. “Together with the Government of British Columbia, we are advancing important work and creating value for all British Columbians by strengthening connections between businesses, communities and sustainable economic growth.”The Province and YVR recognize the benefits of working together to attract clean investment and human capital and to drive sustained economic growth leveraging B.C. StrongerBC economic plan and CleanBC climate plan and YVR as a vital economic asset and crucial driver of B.C.’s economy.“Creating a dynamic marketplace for sustainable made-in-B.C. technologies aligns with work already being done through the Integrated Marketplace program with YVR,” said Brenda Bailey, Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Innovation. “I look forward to building on the work already underway and furthering our efforts toward realizing a clean economy.”As Canada’s second busiest airport, YVR is an economic engine for B.C., connecting people, communities, cargo and markets to the world. This is done through international and domestic services, regional and coastal air services, float planes, helicopter operations, corporate charters, sport fishing camps and aerospace facilities, which connect First Nations and communities throughout B.C., support the delivery of vital services, and facilitate business and economic growth in the province.To kick off this partnership with YVR, the Province is investing in three key projects that will support the broader aviation industry:\n\t$250,000 for a sustainable aviation fuel opportunities study to accelerate the development of sustainable aviation fuels and clean technologies (Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation);\n\t$375,000 to support the creation of a net-zero airports action plan to outline actions for carbon-reduction measures across the B.C. airport network in line with CleanBC objectives (Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure); and\n\t$250,000 for a study to explore opportunities to enhance the movement of people and goods between YVR, Vancouver Island and beyond, to facilitate multi-modal access to new markets and increase the resiliency of supply chains (Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure).\nThe MOU will also help enhance access to reliable, sustainable air services. This is vital to Indigenous communities as it ensures access to critical health and emergency services, supports job creation, creates business and tourism opportunities, and maintains their connection to other parts of the province.“The B.C. Aviation Council applauds Premier Eby and the Government of British Columbia for this strategic initiative in partnership with YVR and B.C.’s aviation and aerospace industry,” said Heather J. McCarley, board chair, British Columbia Aviation Council. “Aviation is a powerful economic generator connecting communities, people and businesses across our province, and facilitates response for medevacs, wildfires, and other emergencies. The long-term sustainability of our industry, both environmental and financial, is vital for the well-being of our province.”Establishing B.C. as a leader in sustainable aviation, clean-technology investment, and building resilient communities aligns with the key objectives of the StrongerBC Economic Plan.Quotes:Josie Osborne, Minister of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation – “To create a more sustainable future, we must continue to prioritize the development of clean fuels and low-carbon technology. By working together with partners like YVR, we pave the way for a future where progress and environmental responsibility go hand in hand, ensuring that B.C. has a thriving, clean economy that works for everyone.”Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure – “Clean and efficient movement of goods and people across all modes of transport supports healthy communities and a thriving economy. The partnership between the Province and YVR will lay the groundwork for common sense solutions, and builds on the work our government is doing to improve goods and people movement across British Columbia.”\nLearn More:For more about the StrongerBC Economic Plan, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/plan/For more information about Integrated Marketplace announcements at YVR, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2024JEDI0008-000207For more about YVR’s Strategic Plan, visit: https://www.yvr.ca/en/about-yvr/2022-2024-strategic-plan/gateway-to-the-new-economy#:~:text=We%20will%20focus%20land%20development,%2Dtech%20and%20bio%2Dtech.For more about YVR’s Roadmap to Net Zero Carbon 2030: https://www.yvr.ca/en/blog/2021/yvr-net-zero-2030Two backgrounders follow.YVR is Canada’s second-largest international airport, having welcomed nearly 25 million passengers in 2023.\n\tThrough its operations, tourism, and cargo, YVR helps facilitate more than $20 billion in total economic output and more than $10 billion in total gross domestic product.\n\tIn addition, YVR supports more than 26,000 jobs on Sea Island where YVR is located, and more than 126,000 jobs throughout the province.\n\tYVR is committed to advancing reconciliation and walking together with Musqueam under its 30-year Sustainability and Friendship Agreement, which is based on friendship and respect to achieve a sustainable future for the community and the lands on which the airport operates.\n\tIn 2021, YVR was the first airport in Canada to commit to net-zero emissions from its operations by 2030.\n\tYVR partnered with the Province in 2022 to deliver an Integrated Marketplace Initiative, making the airport the first test bed under this program that supports made-in-B.C. companies to develop and sell clean-tech solutions locally so they can solve industry challenges.\nThe Government of British Columbia and Vancouver International Airport (YVR) have entered into a partnership, focused on advancing B.C.’s aerospace, aviation and logistics sector and building a stronger economy for people in British Columbia.As Canada’s second-busiest airport, YVR is an economic engine for B.C., connecting people, places, cargo, and markets to the world. YVR is uniquely positioned within Canada to grow as an international hub for zero-carbon innovation, technology, trade, investment and skills training for the aviation and aerospace sectors.The agreement between the Government of British Columbia and YVR will see government immediately invest in B.C.’s sustainable aviation sector. Over the coming years, the Province and YVR have committed to working collaboratively on shared priorities to ensure government policies support future economic growth, competitiveness, affordability and investment.Partnership highlights:The Government of British Columbia will immediately invest in three priority projects:1. Sustainable aviation fuel opportunities study:\n\tThe Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation will provide $250,000 in funding to complete a sustainable aviation fuel opportunities study.\n\tYVR will oversee the study and work with partners in academia, aviation, energy and natural resources to analyze the challenges, opportunities and future commitments needed to develop sustainable aviation fuel capacity in B.C. as central to economic diversification and reducing carbon emissions from aviation.\n\tThe Province will use the data generated from the study to inform future policy decisions that will attract sustainable aviation fuel investment and create provincial economic opportunit\n2. B.C. airports carbon-reduction measures: \n\tThe Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure will provide $375,000 to fund a baseline carbon emissions study for all regional airports in the province.\n\tYVR will oversee the work in collaboration with the B.C. Aviation Council, Victoria International Airport, Kelowna International Airport, and regional and Indigenous airport operators throughout British Columbia.\n\tThe study will inform the development of a net-zero action plan so all airports in B.C. can achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2030.\n3. Multi-modal goods movement: \n\tThe Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure will invest $250,000 to explore opportunities to enhance people and goods movement between Vancouver Island, YVR and beyond.\n\tYVR will conduct a feasibility study to investigate multi-modal air and marine connections between the regions, capitalizing on the population growth and economic potential of Metro Vancouver and Vancouver Island, thereby improving access to global markets, while exploring the potential of new and emerging transportation technologies.\n\tThe work will help position YVR as a key hub within a multi-modal goods movement system to enhance resilience and create new economic development opportunities for B.C. communities.\nAdditionally, over the next three years, the Government of British Columbia and YVR will explore further investments and activities in the following areas:a. Acceleration of sustainable aviation, including leveraging the B.C. Low Carbon Fuel Standard to meet decarbonization targets, adopting green fleets, pursuing energy conservation and electrification projects, and replacing fossil fuels with renewable alternatives.b.

The facility is scheduled to open to commercial long-haul truckers on March 28, 2024.“By investing in a designated truck parking facility, commercial drivers will be able to rest safely and securely after driving long distances transporting goods and materials across Canada to support our economy,” said Randeep Sarai, MP for Surrey Centre, on behalf of Sean Fraser, federal Minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities. “Providing drivers with these essential amenities will allow them to refresh and recharge, ensuring they can continue their journeys efficiently and safely to reach their destinations. We are committed to continuing investment in projects like this one to promote economic growth and build more resilient communities.” The site was chosen for its proximity to major Lower Mainland truck routes. The secured site has parking for 106 commercial trucks, and includes facilities such as washrooms with showers, a sani-dump for drivers, and security measures, such as fencing, cameras and 24-hour security.“Providing adequate parking facilities for commercial drivers to rest and recharge is vital to enhance safety in B.C.’s commercial trucking industry,” said Dave Earle, president and CEO, BC Trucking Association. “This is a great facility that I am confident will be extensively used. I am also pleased to hear that the Province is exploring additional parking options for commercial vehicles as it improves the Highway 1 corridor through the Fraser Valley.”Tybo Contracting Ltd. of Langley was responsible for construction of the new North Surrey Truck Parking Facility. The first phase of work, including a signalized intersection along Highway 17 to provide safe access to the new facility, was completed by contractor Jacob Bros. Construction.The Province of B.C. contributed $17 million to the construction of the new facility, while the federal government is contributing to this project as part of a larger $109-million investment that also includes funding for the widening of the Trans-Canada Highway 1 between 216th and 264th streets. This initiative is funded through the New Building Canada Fund’s Provincial-Territorial Infrastructure Component, National and Regional Projects.",

    "contents": "CHILLIWACK – Young adults and seniors in Chilliwack will soon have access to new affordable homes with the opening of the Paramount.  “We need to make sure Chilliwack stays a place where young people can put down roots and seniors on fixed incomes can live comfortably,” said Premier David Eby. “That’s why our government is supporting unique housing solutions like the Paramount. This affordable intergenerational housing complex for young adults who were formerly youth in care and seniors is the first of its kind in British Columbia and will provide residents with community, support and belonging.”The Paramount is six-storey building at 46187 Yale Rd. and will be available to adults between the ages of 19 and 25, and seniors with low to moderate incomes. Priority will be given to young adults who were formerly in care.“The Paramount project is another example of what can be achieved when all levels of government work together,” said Sean Fraser, federal Minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities. “This partnership will help ensure that Chilliwack’s seniors and youth have safe and affordable homes where they can start new chapters. This is the National Housing Strategy at work and we will continue working to ensure that everyone from coast to coast to coast has a place to call their own.”The project follows an increasingly popular housing trend in North America, which is new to Chilliwack. The Paramount connects young adults leaving the child welfare system with seniors in the community. This project will help grow an informal network of support between generations and address an established need for community and connections. The Chilliwack Community Service Society is exploring community gathering and mentorship opportunities between young adults and senior residents.“Affordable housing is essential for young people beginning to live on their own. This is especially true for young adults who are transitioning from government care and face higher risks of homelessness,” said Grace Lore, B.C.’s Minister of Children and Family Development. “The Paramount building is a new solution to an important challenge that builds a sense of community, while providing more homes for those who need them most.”The Paramount is a partnership between the B.C. government and Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the City of Chilliwack and Chilliwack Community Services, which will operate the building. It contains commercial and residential spaces, as well as laundry and lounge spaces. Its studio, one- and two-bedroom units will have rents between $445 per month for a studio and $1,500 per month for a two-bedroom unit. Thirteen units are wheelchair accessible.This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has approximately 78,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway, including nearly 500 homes in the City of Chilliwack. Quotes:Dan Coulter, MLA for Chilliwack – “Through our Homes for People action plan, we’re ensuring everyone has access to affordable housing.

    "contents": "SURREY – Nearly 2,000 new affordable homes are on the way for renters in Metro Vancouver, through partnerships between the Province and local non-profit housing providers.“Everyone deserves a decent home they can actually afford,” said Premier David Eby. “That’s why we’re taking unprecedented actions to rapidly build more affordable housing throughout the province, including through the Community Housing Fund. This latest round of funding will bring much-needed homes to every region of our province – from our fastest-growing cities to rural and remote areas – helping everyone find a decent home in the community they love.”A total of 17 new projects in Metro Vancouver have been selected through the third intake of the Building BC: Community Housing Fund (CHF). The proposed projects will provide a total of 1,954 affordable rental homes for individuals, families, seniors, people living with disabilities and Indigenous people in B.C.“Through our Homes for People action plan, we are taking action to deliver affordable housing faster, and the Community Housing Fund is a key part of the plan,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “These new homes mean that more people in B.C. will benefit from affordable homes in the communities they love, where they can grow their families and age in place.”The announcement took place at 7567-140 St. in Surrey, the future site of an affordable housing project that will be operated by Kekinow Native Housing Society. Expected to be completed in late spring 2024, the project previously received CHF funding for Phase 2 of the development to build more than 100 homes for Indigenous people. The society will be receiving CHF funding for another project as one of the successful proponents from the CHF call for proposals issued in fall 2023.“On behalf of the Kekinow board of directors, we would like to thank Premier Eby and BC Housing for supporting our work to provide safe and affordable housing to Indigenous people in Surrey,” said Rupinder Cheema, CEO, Kekinow Native Housing Society. “This project will add 62 affordable housing units to help reduce the gap between demand and supply. The project approval by the Province is a step forward to help with social determinant of wellness.”Including these projects, the Province, through BC Housing, has identified more than 40 new projects to move forward, totalling approximately 3,500 affordable rental homes. Additional projects on Vancouver Island, in the Interior and North will be announced later this week. This brings the total to 12,500 affordable rental homes that are already open or underway through the CHF program since its launch in 2018.“The Kekinow Native Housing Society provides a safe place to raise our children, where we feel safe and supported,” said Philip Gladue, a renter in Surrey. “As a community, we continue to work with Kekinow to help them in their ongoing support for the Indigenous community and welcome this new project.”The Community Housing Fund is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has nearly 78,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway.Quotes:Rachna Singh, MLA for Surrey-Green Timbers — “People in the region, including Surrey, who are struggling to find homes that meet their needs will have more affordable housing options with these new homes on the way. This is made possible by our partnerships with local non-profit organizations as we collectively address the housing affordability crisis we are facing. I look forward to seeing the positive impacts these homes will bring to the people and the community in the years to come.”Jill Atkey, CEO, BC Non-Profit Housing Association —“The rental housing crisis touches every corner of British Columbia, and we’re thrilled to see that non-profits in Metro Vancouver will soon be constructing more than 1,900 new affordable rental homes. These homes are critical for British Columbians experiencing affordability challenges today, but importantly, they will also be home to thousands more in the generations to come. But our work is not done, and we will continue to push every government to increase investment into safe, secure and affordable housing.”Quick Facts:\n\tThe CHF is a $3.3-billion investment that targets to build more than 20,000 affordable rental homes for people with moderate- and low-income households by 2031-32.\n\tBC Housing is supporting non-profit housing providers to prepare for future CHF funding calls, with the next call expected in late 2024 or early 2025.\n\tUnder the CHF program, residents of 70% of the units pay rent geared to income, where rent is generally based on 30% of household income.\n\t\tThis includes 20% of units for residents with very low incomes, such as those receiving income or disability assistance.\n\t\n\tThe remaining 30% of units are available at or below market rents for households with moderate incomes.\nLearn More:To learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/A backgrounder follows.\n\tBella Coola, Anukaliakuulhla Mnmntni, Bella Coola IR1: 20 homes for Indigenous elders, in partnership with the Nuxalk Nation.\n\tBowen Island, 1033 Miller Rd.: 24 homes for families and seniors, in partnership with Lookout Housing and Health Society.\n\tBurnaby, 4170 James St.: 118 homes for individuals, families and seniors, in partnership with the New Vista Society.\n\tBurnaby, 7000 Lougheed Hwy.: 66 homes for Indigenous and non-Indigenous families and seniors, in partnership with M'akola Housing Society.\n\tBurnaby, 3755 McGill St.: 48 homes for seniors, in partnership with Action Line Housing Society.\n\tCoquitlam, 290 Laval Square and 602 Sydney Ave.: 158 homes for families and seniors, in partnership with S.U.C.C.E.S.S.

Five per cent of the units will be fully accessible for people living with disabilities.Construction is expected to be complete in late 2025.“This housing project demonstrates how partnerships between government and non-governmental agencies can create much-needed affordable, rental and special needs housing in the community,” said Malcolm Brodie, mayor of Richmond. “These 80 units will provide rental homes for Richmond residents at various income levels and accommodate single people, families and seniors. It is yet another example of the city’s Affordable Housing Strategy in action. We look forward to seeing even more housing opportunities developed for Richmond residents in the coming months.”The building will be conveniently located in the heart of Richmond, close to Richmond General Hospital, Dover Neighbourhood Park and dyke trails, as well as schools and other community amenities, such as the Richmond Olympic Oval.“Our community in Richmond is growing fast and with this new development, more families and individuals will have access to housing that is within their budget,” said Henry Yao, MLA for Richmond South Centre. “The Pathways Clubhouse building will be an additional support for people who are struggling with the cost of living, while also lowering barriers for people living with disabilities.”This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government.

The new 12-storey building has studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom homes and will be owned and operated by Brightside. The building features a range of shared amenities, such as an outdoor common area and rooftop urban agriculture space.“With these new homes now built, more families, seniors and individuals can remain in our community with their family and friends,” said Joan Phillip, MLA for Vancouver-Mount Pleasant. “Thank you to our project partners, Brightside Community Homes Foundation and Wall Financial Corporation, for their work on bringing The Aster to our community.”The Aster replaces Brightside’s 36-unit seniors housing building at 325 E. 6th Ave., which lacks much-needed accessibility features and will be sold to Wall Financial Corporation for redevelopment into market and social housing.“We’re incredibly proud to be opening these new affordable homes in Mount Pleasant,” said William Azaroff, CEO, Brightside Community Homes Foundation. “The Aster represents the first of hundreds of new affordable rental homes Brightside will be opening over the coming years and provincial funding for The Aster has helped us maximize affordability.”The new building is providing existing tenants with better quality and more affordable homes. As construction is complete, tenants are moving from their homes at 325 E. 6th Ave. to The Aster and will continue to pay the same rents based on income.“I know there will be a positive impact for the seniors and people living in these homes, and their families,” said Brenda Bailey, MLA for Vancouver-False Creek. “I look forward to seeing more homes like these built in B.C., so more people can access homes they can afford. Thank you to Wall Financial for making the land available and its work building The Aster, and to Brightside Community Homes for its leadership and vision.”Forty-two of The Aster’s units will have rent geared to income, where rent is 30% of the tenant’s income. Nineteen units are for people with very low incomes, such as those receiving income or disability assistance, or a basic seniors’ pension. Twenty-one units are set at low-end market rates, ranging from $1,700 to $3,100 per month.“Wall Financial is committed to continue working with the city and BC Housing to develop rental and affordable housing in the City of Vancouver,” said Bruno Wall, CEO, Wall Financial Corporation.This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government.

    "contents": "VICTORIA – People who commute and rely on transit between the Westshore and downtown Victoria can expect easier, more reliable travel with improvements coming to the Colquitz River Bridges.The Highway 1-Colquitz River Bridge Widening Project will widen and seismically retrofit both existing two-lane bridges over Burnside Road on Highway 1. A bus-on-shoulder lane will be added to each bridge, connecting and extending the bus lanes in both directions from Tillicum Road to the McKenzie Interchange. The changes remove a key pinch point by creating a continuous transit corridor between downtown Victoria and the McKenzie Interchange, reducing traffic congestion and improving service reliability.“We know this area is only getting busier and it’s crucial we have a strong transportation network that people can count on to get to and from their work, homes and families between downtown and the Westshore,” said Rob Fleming, B.C. Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “This project is another step toward improving our climate resiliency and making our infrastructure sustainable long into the future.”The project also includes significant environmental improvements to support the sensitive habitat in and around Colquitz River. A new bridge-deck drainage system with a rain garden and sediment catch basin will be installed to filter roadway runoff, improving water quality in the creek. Non-native and invasive plants will be replaced with native trees and vegetation. The ministry worked with the region’s local governments and environmental groups to complete the designs.“To build a brighter future for Canadians, the federal government is investing in projects that improve connectivity and resiliency,” said Jonathan Wilkinson, federal Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, and member of Parliament for North Vancouver, on behalf of Sean Fraser, federal Minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities. “Widening the Colquitz River bridges will make for a more reliable, efficient commute for south Islanders while protecting local waterways and ecosystems. We will continue investing in public transit infrastructure that makes it easier for residents to navigate their communities and that contributes to a greener future.”The construction contract was awarded to Pomerleau Inc., with construction anticipated to start in summer 2024 and project completion forecast for fall of 2025. Highway 1 and Burnside Road West will remain open throughout the construction period with lane closures limited to off-peak hours. No changes are planned for bus service through construction.“Transit is vital to our region and this infrastructure improvement will make the bus more convenient for people who commute in and out of the downtown core,” said Bruce Williams, chief executive officer of the Greater Victoria Chamber of Commerce. “Supporting the long-term health of the Colquitz habitat also supports the residents and businesses in that neighbourhood who understand the value this natural environment provides to our region.” The total project investment is $35.5 million, with the Province contributing $23.5 million and the federal government contributing $12 million through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program.The project is a part of the Province’s South Island Transportation Strategy, which focuses on improving the sustainability and resiliency in southern Vancouver Island communities through highway, transit and active transportation improvements.Learn More:For more information on the improvements coming to the Colquitz River Bridges, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation-projects/other-transportation-projects/colquitz-river-bridges",

Early work on the terminal begins immediately, with estimated completion in fall 2024.The contract for Phase I wharf modifications has been awarded to Pacific Industrial & Marine Ltd. Offsite work on the wharf is about to begin near Cowichan Bay. Wharf work at the terminal is expected to begin this summer.“This terminal represents a critical trade junction for our region and the country as a whole,” said Rob Fleming, B.C. Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “Moving forward with this project to transform it into an improved, modern entry point will not only generate economic growth on both sides of the border, it will make travel more convenient and enjoyable for the people travelling through this hub every year.”The project is also advancing toward the Phase II permanent upgrades to the terminal. The shortlisted proponents invited to participate in a request for proposal include EllisDon Corporation, KL Belleville Terminal Partners and Pomerleau Inc.“We are proud to see the next phase of this project, which is integral to the future of trade, travel and tourism in Victoria, roll out,” said Sean Fraser, federal minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities. “The Belleville terminal redevelopment will respect modern safety and security standards, while facilitating the movement of both goods and people into the heart of Victoria’s inner harbour. We will continue supporting projects, such as this one, that will strengthen our economy for decades to come.”During the first phase of construction, people can expect to see closed pedestrian access along the causeway behind the Steamship building, along with the addition of a large temporary structure behind the building this spring. Some noise is anticipated during this phase due to construction work in the coming weeks to modify the wharf and building. There will be no impact to current Clipper and Coho ferry sailings during construction. “We are thrilled to see this project advancing as the redevelopment of the terminal has been our number 1 priority for the last three decades,” said Paul Nursey, CEO of Destination Greater Victoria. “This is an act of future-proofing our region, our businesses and our relationships with visitors from the U.S., and it keeps Greater Victoria looking like the remarkable destination it truly is.”The terminal acts as an international gateway for goods, services and passengers, and drives regional and provincial economic growth. Travellers spend approximately $174 million annually, generating $268 million in economic output and $155 million in provincial gross domestic product (GDP).The upgrade brings the terminal into compliance with the Canada-U.S. Land, Rail, Marine and Air Transport Pre-clearance Agreement, and will streamline travel by allowing passengers to complete the customs and immigration process in Victoria prior to disembarking in the U.S.The project is expected to be complete in time for the 2028 tourism season, with a budget of $303.9 million and a $41.6-million federal contribution.  The Province is working collaboratively with the Songhees and Esquimalt Nations to identify opportunities to showcase the cultural and geographical significance of the project’s location and welcome visitors into Lekwungen territory.Learn More:Visit the Belleville Project website for the latest updates: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/bellevilleterminal",

    "title": "Commercial truck drivers to face higher penalties for hitting overpasses",
    "resolutionId": null,
    "meetingType": "Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure",
    "contents": "VICTORIA – Drivers of commercial trucks involved in infrastructure crashes will face higher penalties, with the government taking stronger action to make highway travel safer for everyone.The proposed changes to the Commercial Transport Act (CTA) will enable the courts to impose fines for as much as $100,000, as well as imprisonment up to 18 months upon conviction for violations. Infrastructure crashes pose a significant safety risk, having caused millions of dollars in provincial highway repairs, as well as lengthy highway closures and supply chain disruptions that impact all British Columbians.“With these new penalties, we are taking the strongest action possible to keep our roads safe and to keep people, goods and services moving,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “This also sends a message to commercial truck drivers that they are responsible for the safe transportation of goods and services on our roads, and a lax attitude toward safety will not be tolerated.”The legislative changes are in response to 35 crashes that have occurred since late 2021 by over-height commercial vehicles. Laws surrounding highway infrastructure crashes have not changed since the 1970s. The overwhelming majority of responsible truck drivers and the trucking industry have urged tougher action on the small number of irresponsible operators that have caused these crashes.The proposed maximum penalty for commercial transport violations is far above other Canadian provinces and territories, and falls in line with the maximum penalties applied to rail and dangerous-goods safety. The BC Trucking Association has been consulted and supports the proposed increase in maximum penalties.“The BC Trucking Association welcomes the legislative change by the Province to hold carriers accountable,” said Dave Earle, president and CEO, BC Trucking Association. “Imposing stricter penalties for carriers supports road safety and helps protect infrastructure, and ultimately enhances safety for everyone on our roads.”This change represents the latest in a series of steps the ministry has taken recently to address the issue, including formalizing a progressive-enforcement framework and carrier-suspension policy that provides escalating consequences for carriers who commit repeat offences, including the possible loss of safety certificates, prohibiting their operation. Fines were recently raised to the highest amount allowed under the current law for over-height vehicles, from $100 to the maximum allowable penalty of $500. A new requirement was also put in place (effective June 1, 2024) for in-cab warning devices to alert dump-style vehicle operators when the dump box is raised. Speed-limiter devices were also mandated, preventing heavy commercial vehicles from travelling more than 105 km/h on B.C. highways.The Province has successfully taken up this issue with federal, provincial and territorial counterparts through the Council of Ministers Responsible for Transportation and Highway Safety. The council is working to address loopholes where carriers with problematic safety records prohibited in one jurisdiction may continue operating in a neighbouring jurisdiction. To support the commercial transport industry through this change, the ministry is developing training material that provides commercial drivers guidance on the proper measurement of vehicles and loads. The proper measurement of vehicle/load height is a component of the Mandatory Entry Level Training (MELT) program for Class 1 drivers.The ministry will continue to evaluate and update policies and actions to ensure drivers are well-trained and companies are held accountable.Learn More:To learn more about recent changes the ministry made regarding the commercial-truck driving industry, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023MOTI0207-001985  For more information about B.C. legislation, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/Legislation",

    "contents": "PENDER ISLAND – Repair work is expected to begin this week on a section of Canal Road on South Pender Island that was damaged during heavy rain and flooding in November 2021.Dynamite Construction has been awarded the contract to carry out permanent repairs on the damaged section of road, approximately 2.5 kilometres east of the Pender Canal Bridge, which links North Pender Island and South Pender Island. The work will increase the road’s resiliency during future extreme rainfalls, helping to keep Pender Island residents safe and connected.The work will include clearing, rock blasting and offloading the existing slide and roadway, as well as realigning the road onto solid bedrock, upsizing the existing culvert, installing a reinforced retaining wall and building a temporary barge-landing facility at Boundary Passage Drive to transport equipment and materials. This phase of the project is expected to be complete by late 2024.Residents and visitors can expect to see initial work mobilizing this week, with single-lane-alternating traffic in place for the duration of the project. For more complex work, some temporary longer road closures may be needed at off-peak travel times.Drivers should plan for delays along this route throughout the project, such as road closures that may last as long as four hours between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. All efforts will be made to minimize traffic disruptions.Drivers are reminded to drive for the conditions, observe construction-zone speed limits and follow the direction of traffic-control signs and personnel.Updates will be available at @DriveBC on X (Twitter) \nand online: https://DriveBC.caThe friendly url is: https://www.gov.bc.ca/canal-road-dip-slide",

    "contents": "VICTORIA – The Province has updated the Provincial Policy Manual: Transit-Oriented Areas (TOA manual) to ensure local governments are supported in delivering the housing and amenities people need in areas near transit hubs.On Dec. 7, 2023, the Province released the TOA manual that local governments must consider when implementing the requirements of the new Housing Statutes (Transit-Oriented Areas) Amendment Act, 2023, S.B.C. 2023, c.48 legislation, also known as Bill 47. The TOA manual has been recently updated to reflect changes on the use of the density bonus tool in TOAs.Density bonus is a zoning tool that permits developers to build additional density in exchange for public amenities or affordable housing. Local governments use this tool to help deliver much-needed affordable housing and public amenities that support community growth.The TOA manual sets the expectation that density bonus in TOAs would use a base density consistent with the minimum allowable densities established in the TOA regulations. Since the release of the TOA manual, several local governments have shared concerns that this approach would significantly limit their ability to use the density bonus tool in TOAs and secure affordable housing and public amenities through TOA development.In response to feedback and as an interim measure, local governments will be permitted to use existing base densities established in their respective zoning bylaws, even if they are below the minimum allowable densities, when using the density bonus tool.This approach will provide greater clarity for developers and ensure local governments can continue to secure the benefits of the density bonus through TOA development in the near term, while the Province shifts toward an increasingly proactive land-use planning framework in the long term.It is anticipated that by mid-2025, local governments will transition to using new proactive planning tools to secure affordable housing and community amenities through TOA development, such as amenity cost charges and other tools under development.Learn More:To access the updated TOA manual, visit:\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/local-governments-and-housing/housing-initiatives/transit-oriented-development-areasTo learn more about local government housing initiatives to help build homes faster, visit:\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/local-governments-and-housing/housing-initiativesTo learn about government’s Homes for People action plan, visit:\nhttps://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit:\nhttps://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/",

    "meetingType": "Ministry of HousingOffice of the Minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities",
    "contents": "COQUITLAM – Families and individuals in Coquitlam now have access to 164 affordable rental homes as people move into Robert Nicklin Place.“Robert Nicklin Place addresses the urgent need for housing in Coquitlam, including low-income homes for vulnerable renters and homes that are rent-geared to income,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “These are designed to be the kind of sustainable homes that give people stable and affordable housing in a housing crisis adding 164 much-needed units to the rental housing stock. The people who live in these homes will benefit from a wealth of nearby amenities and be part of a thriving community.”Robert Nicklin Place is a six-storey wood-frame apartment building at 3100 Ozada Ave. and is operated by Affordable Housing Societies (AHS). It has 164 units made up of 65 one-bedroom units, 69 two-bedroom units and 30 three-bedroom units. Tenant priority is for families with low incomes as well as seniors, people living with disabilities and people with low to moderate incomes.“With these new homes now built, families, seniors and individuals can remain in our community with their family and friends,” said Fin Donnelly, MLA for Coquitlam-Burke Mountain. “I thank the many project partners for their work on this, including Affordable Housing Societies, the federal government and the City of Coquitlam, for bringing Robert Nicklin Place to our community.”The Province’s investment will ensure 74 of the units are affordable, of which 16 are deep-subsidy units for households with very low incomes, 36 units will have rent geared to income, and 22 are affordable market-rental units. Tenants will benefit from nearby community amenities such as the Millennium Line Lincoln Station, schools, a child care centre, neighbourhood parks, a public library, a hospital and a community centre. Affordable Housing Societies, the City of Coquitlam and the Canada Housing and Mortgage Corporation (CMHC) are also contributing to the project, including 90 market units.“At AHS we are excited to honour Bob Nicklin – one of the great leaders in B.C.’s social housing sector – in such a meaningful way through the opening of this beautiful building, which is going to have a profound impact in the Coquitlam community for generations to come,” said Stephen Bennett, CEO of Affordable Housing Societies.Robert Nicklin served as CEO of the Affordable Housing Societies for 27 years and made innumerable contributions to social housing in B.C. during that time. He passed away in 2016, and the name Robert Nicklin Place was given to this project as a reflection of his ongoing legacy.This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has nearly 78,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway, including more than 1,000 homes in the Tri-Cities of Port Coquitlam, Coquitlam and Port Moody.\nQuotes:Ken Hardie, MP for Fleetwood-Port Kells – “Today marks an important milestone as we celebrate 164 affordable homes in Coquitlam. This new living environment will allow residents to remain in their community, close to their loved ones. Our government is proud to invest in this project that will improve the quality of life of those who will call it home. By working closely with our partners to create more affordable housing, our government continues to achieve meaningful results for Canadians.”Richard Stewart, mayor, Coquitlam –  \"The official opening of Robert Nicklin Place highlights Coquitlam’s focused efforts on enabling safe and affordable housing solutions in our community. The city is proud to have contributed $3.3 million from our Affordable Housing Reserve Fund, which is an integral source of funding for much-needed housing projects like this. I’m particularly pleased that the project was named to honour Robert Nicklin, someone I knew and worked with decades ago, someone whose career showed his long dedication to the importance of stable and affordable housing for families.”George V. Harvie, chair, Metro Vancouver Board of Directors –“We’re pleased to contribute to the creation of new affordable homes for families and individuals in Coquitlam, both through Metro Vancouver Housing expansion projects, and by supporting partner organizations.

A contract has been awarded to Civil North Consulting Ltd. for $2.2 million to build a CVSE inspection pullout 12 kilometres south of Barriere for southbound travel. Construction begins in spring 2024 and is scheduled to be complete by fall 2024.In addition to the pullout construction on Highway 5 North, the Province is also launching a new average-speed data-collection system for research purposes between Kamloops and Avola. Speed data will be collected with cameras that will calculate the average speed of vehicles travelling between two distant points along the highway. The project will provide accurate information about vehicle speeds along the highway and help inform future decisions to further improve safety. The cameras will be used only for ministry data gathering and not speed enforcement, which is the responsibility of police. The cameras are expected to be installed in spring 2024.These initiatives highlight the Province’s dedication to the safety and well-being of all travellers on Highway 5 North. By investing in infrastructure improvements and innovative technologies, the Province is working to create safer roadways for all British Columbians.Learn More:For more information on average-speed over distance technology, visit: https://www.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/vehicle-safety-enforcement/information-education/average-speed-over-distance-technology",

We’re helping Hollyburn Delbrook add 86 additional rental homes in an area where affordable homes are much needed.”Construction is already underway and is expected to be completed by 2025.The project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has nearly 78,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway, including more than 1,500 on the North Shore.Quotes: Jason Wexler, board director, Hollyburn Community Housing Society –“Hollyburn has recognized this burgeoning need for some time, and we are excited to now see the building begin construction. We are very grateful for the commitment and support from the Province, the District of North Vancouver and BC Housing. We look forward to the completion when we can welcome families to their new homes.”Genesa Greening, CEO of Vancity Community Foundation –“Building affordable and secure homes creates thriving communities where people can live healthy lives and the Vancity Community Foundation is proud to have played an early role in supporting this project through our Affordable Housing Accelerator Program.

    "contents": "ESQUIMALT – People living in 16 homes will have safe and secure housing as Lu’ma Native Housing Society is buying an apartment building facing potential redevelopment in Esquimalt.The purchase is through a funding contribution from the Rental Protection Fund.“The goal of the Rental Protection Fund is to ensure people and families, including those living in these 16 homes, will have the security and safety of staying in the place they know and the community they love,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “The Rental Protection Fund is making it possible for Lu’ma Native Housing to ensure current tenants will not face renoviction or displacement — and that’s exactly why our government made the initial investment in the fund.”Lu’ma Native Housing is purchasing the 16-unit apartment building at 860 Carrie St. for $5.3 million, using a $3-million contribution from the Rental Protection Fund. Lu’ma Native Housing will contribute the balance through low-interest financing. The building was listed for sale and was at risk of redevelopment and potential tenant displacement.Built in 1971, the building features four studio units and 12 one-bedroom units. People living in the building will be able to stay there with the same rents. Lu’ma Native Housing will manage renovations to the roof, the building exterior and upgrades within three units. These renovations will prolong the building’s lifespan without disrupting tenancies.“I look forward to seeing the impact the Rental Protection Fund has on the tenants of this building and for the people in all the buildings it helps secure,” said Mitzi Dean, MLA for Esquimalt-Metchosin. “Thanks to Lu’ma Native Housing Society for its leadership on acquiring this building and ensuring the current tenants have continued secure housing, while also planning for much-needed Indigenous-focused housing here in Esquimalt.”Lu’ma Native Housing manages its buildings with a culturally appropriate lens, while prioritizing housing for Indigenous people. Over time, as units become available at 860 Carrie St., Lu’ma will make them available to Indigenous people.“Lu’ma Development Management is grateful for the opportunity to support our client to purchase this building and protect these 16 units,” said Dave Ward, CEO, Lu’ma Development Management. “We are honoured to work with Indigenous housing providers, who continue to demonstrate not only their capacity but their willingness to grow, innovate and adapt to tools like the Rental Protection Fund. At Lu’ma, we envision a future where Indigenous people thrive through self-determination and are connected to their communities and traditions, and we look forward to implementing this service delivery model in Esquimalt.”The $500-million Rental Protection Fund is part of the Province’s Homes for People action plan, which includes addressing the crucial need for new Indigenous housing throughout B.C. The Rental Protection Fund has approved funding to preserve nearly 700 homes throughout the Province that will be announced in the coming months, with thousands of additional homes under funding consideration.Quotes:Margaret Pfoh, CEO, Aboriginal Housing Management Association (AHMA) – “AHMA being a full and equal partner at the table of the Rental Protection Fund is an excellent example of elevating Indigenous leadership. We celebrate our member, Lu’ma Native Housing Society, for their involvement in this acquisition, which helps preserve affordable rental units for future generations.”Katie Maslechko, CEO of the Rental Protection Fund –“Investments from the Rental Protection Fund don't just bridge the equity gap required to keep these homes affordable, they address the gap in equitable access to capital. This is just the first of many acquisitions through the Rental Protection Fund that will provide renters with meaningful, immediate housing security, while growing the capacity of our Indigenous-led housing providers, like Lu'ma Native Housing Society, by tens of millions of dollars.”Barbara Desjardins, mayor of Esquimalt – “People who are part of the community can stay in the community, thanks to the forward-thinking approach of Lu’ma Native Housing Society and the support of the Ministry of Housing. Not only are we seeing the positive effects today, but will see value in the future as spaces open up for Indigenous households.”Quick Facts:\n\tSince fall 2023, non-profit housing providers have been removing homes from the speculative market through pre-qualified application grants from the Rental Protection Fund.\n\tMore than 2,000 units, otherwise destined for sale to the private market, have had property owners sell the property to non-profit housing providers, ensuring housing stability for the residents.   \n\tThe Rental Protection Fund has pre-qualified 25 non-profit organizations and advanced 36 proposals for consideration. \nLearn More:For information about the Rental Protection Fund, visit: https://rentalprotectionfund.ca",

    "contents": "VANCOUVER – As part of Budget 2024 measures that will increase supply and make homes more affordable and accessible, the Province is taking action against speculators and those who profit from “flipping” homes.“Families shouldn’t have to compete with house-flipping investors when they’re trying to buy a home,” said Premier David Eby. “This tax will deter speculators and give families looking for a place to live an advantage in our housing market.”Legislation to introduce the B.C. home-flipping tax will be introduced in spring 2024. If passed, it will take effect Jan. 1, 2025. At that time, any home sold within two years of purchase will be taxed, with the revenue funding new homes. Exemptions to the home-flipping tax will be available to people who face unavoidable life changes, including death and divorce, job relocation or loss, and people who are adding to B.C.’s housing supply.“We know that people are struggling to find homes to rent or buy in areas that are close to work and their families,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Finance. “We want people to know our government has your back. That’s why Budget 2024 takes further steps to deliver more housing for people faster and make sure homes are lived in.”The flipping tax complements other measures B.C. has taken to discourage housing speculation, including a speculation and vacancy tax, which is estimated to have freed up at least 20,000 homes in Metro Vancouver alone. The Province is also investing billions in B.C. Builds to build homes for the middle class.“For many people, housing is their number 1 concern,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “We are delivering results, but we’re not done. B.C. Builds is going to deliver thousands of middle-class homes in communities people want to live in.”In fall 2023, B.C. introduced reforms to limit short-term rentals in cities where vacancy rates are low.\"I had been looking for a new apartment — right when the timing of the new short-term rental legislation hit the media. Just a couple of days later, more than a few of the listings I was seeing online were obviously ex-AirBnbs,” said Andrew Rideout, a renter from Vancouver. “I was able to sign on one really quickly at a decent price with some really good amenities. Without the new rules, my place wouldn't have been available and I wanted to let Premier Eby know that, at the very least, he helped me snap up a great apartment in my favourite neighbourhood.”A backgrounder follows.\n\tThe home-flipping tax will apply to homes sold within two years.\n\tHomes sold within the first year will face a tax rate of 20% of the profit, declining to zero over the next 365 days.\n\tBetween 2020 and 2022, an estimated 7% of residential house sales were resold within two years.\n\tStarting April 1, 2024, people may be eligible for the First Time Home Buyers’ Program for homes valued up to $835,000, paying no property transfer tax on the first $500,000.\n\tPartial exemptions are available on homes valued up to $860,000, which could result in savings of up to $8,000.\n\tAlso starting April 1, 2024, a Newly Built Home Exemption means property transfer tax will be waived on new homes worth up to $1.1 million, an increase from the previous $750,000 price limit, to encourage new home building.\n\tRental home construction is being encouraged through an enhancement to the exemption for purpose-built rentals.\n\tBetween Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2030, purchases of qualifying rentals will be exempt from the general property transfer tax.",

    "resolutionId": "",
    "contents": "Resolution: n/aCrystal Laderas, SWAN Vancouver, read a statement on behalf of Executive Director of SWAN Vancouver, Angela Wu, expressing Ms. Wu’s concerns regarding the escalated bylaw enforcement and increase in bylaw fines at body rub studios. She voiced her concerns that moving forward with these recommendations will endanger these women and that the licenced body rub businesses are the safest places for these women to work. Ms. Wu suggested that staff speak with Community based organizations and learn from other municipalities that have adopted sex work guidelines. In response to queries from Council, the delegate noted that (i) the sex worker guidelines and the BC Association of Chiefs of Police sex work enforcement guidelines are closely aligned, (ii) the guidelines encourage compassionate interactions with workers to build trust with that community, (iii) bylaw fines issued in Richmond are for unregistered employees, but it is important to review why there is not compliance in this area, and (iv) women working in body rub studios are willing to register but are fearful of the stigma and invasion of their privacy this may bring. Bronwyn McBride, provided a summary on how enforcement of massage parlours impacts women’s safety and their ability to trust and access police protections. Ms. McBride expressed that licensed workplaces are the safest spaces for women in this work environment. The motions put forward will undermine the safety of women as the increase in enforcement will displace women to unlicensed workplaces putting them at greater risk of violence. In response to queries from Council, the delegate noted that (i) a licenced indoor space with other workers and security supports in place is important to ensure safety of women working in the sex trade, (ii) sex work cannot be legislated away it can be made safer or less safe, and (iii) these policy and bylaws should be based on consultation with the effected communities to understand what is required to ensure their safety.",

    "contents": "VICTORIA – A memorandum of understanding (MOU) has been formalized between the Province and the City of Victoria to co-ordinate rapid supports for people experiencing homelessness in the community.“People experiencing homelessness in Victoria will have better access to a range of services through this agreement between the Province and the City of Victoria,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “We all know that encampments are not a safe place for people to live. This partnership will result in better homelessness response actions, so people can have access to appropriate supports and services quickly.”The MOU reaffirms the commitment between the Province and the city to work together to address homelessness in the community. Through the Homeless Encampment Action Response Teams (HEART) and the Homeless Encampment Action Response Temporary Housing (HEARTH) programs, the health and safety of people are prioritized by providing rapid and co-ordinated multidisciplinary responses when encampments arise.“The Province and the city continue to work together to tackle the urgent need for housing, shelter and social support in our community,” said Marianne Alto, mayor of Victoria. “This partnership underscores our ongoing commitment to human-centred solutions for people experiencing homelessness in Victoria. With this MOU, we can rely on the Province to take advantage of opportunities and undertake innovative actions – partners in a comprehensive strategy to provide rapid access to the supports and services needed to help unhoused people find a home. The reopening of this housing on Caledonia is the first act in that partnership.”Under the agreement, the Province, through BC Housing, is reopening the 30-unit Caledonia Place (formerly Tiny Town) at 940 Caledonia Ave., with funding from the HEARTH program. The units, intended to be temporary, will provide interim housing for people who have been staying in shelters long term and free up shelter spaces for people sheltering outdoors. Our Place Society, which operated the former Tiny Town, will operate Caledonia Place until September 2025.“We know that small, well-managed sites, like the former Tiny Town, can be safe for both those needing support and the neighbourhoods around them when they are appropriately located,” said Chief Const. Del Manak, Victoria Police Department. “We support this approach to finding solutions for our most vulnerable populations and look forward to continuing our work toward a safer community together.”In addition to implementing HEART and HEARTH in Victoria, the Province has expanded shelter capacity by providing additional operating funding so that St. John the Divine Church extreme-weather response shelter can operate as a temporary winter shelter. Thirty beds at 1611 Quadra St. are open every night through the shelter season. The shelter is operated by SOLID Outreach Society.Together, these 60 temporary spaces will increase the housing and shelter options available to people experiencing homelessness in the community, while the Province, through BC Housing, works to bring other temporary housing and permanent supportive housing to Victoria.Quotes: Grace Lore, MLA for Victoria-Beacon Hill – “Working together is key if we want to prevent homelessness in our community and that is why this partnership is critical to our work. When vulnerable people have safe housing with supports such as health care and skills training, they can start to rebuild their lives, supporting healthy and safe communities for everyone.”Leah Young, director of housing and shelter, Our Place Society –  “Our Place Society is excited to be a part of the new homelessness programs in Victoria. We are glad to be able to provide more shelter and housing to people who desperately need it and we will be managing it with a similar approach as done before. The small, supported-housing site worked well and its strength was building a community for all involved.”Learn More:To read the MOU, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/BC_Victoria_MOU_HEART_and_HEARTH.pdfFor more information about the HEART and HEARTH program, visit: https://www.bchousing.org/housing-assistance/homelessness-services/HEART-HEARTHTo read the Belonging in BC plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/BelongingStrategy.pdfA backgrounder follows.\n\tThe HEART and HEARTH programs are part of the Belonging in BC homelessness plan to prevent and reduce homelessness.\n\tThe HEARTH program will provide funding for rapid development of emergency housing and shelter options to quickly assist people sheltering outdoors.\n\tLeveraging local resources, the HEART program will bring together the provincial and local governments, Indigenous partners, health-care agencies and non-profit organizations to quickly assess the needs of people sheltering in encampments and provide rapid access to the supports and services they need to find a home.\n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, provided approximately $400,000 to purchase the former Tiny Town structures and will provide about $1.4 million in operating funding to Caledonia Place through the HEARTH funding program.\n\tThrough the MOU, the city commits to bring forward available land and expedite land-use decisions for new shelter and supportive-housing projects.\n\tVictoria joins other municipalities, such as Prince George, Kelowna, Abbotsford and Nanaimo, in partnering with the Province and BC Housing to implement HEART and HEARTH programs.\n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, is providing approximately $431,000 in operating funding to St. John the Divine Church temporary winter shelter through the Emergency Shelter Program.\n\tThere are currently 380 overnight shelter spaces, including an extreme-weather response (EWR) shelter, in Greater Victoria. With the exception of 30 EWR beds at the Salvation Army Addictions & Rehabilitation Centre, located at 525 Johnson St. and opens only when an extreme-weather alert is issued, the remainder are permanent or winter shelters that are open every night.",

    "contents": "VANCOUVER – BC Builds, the Province’s new initiative to build more housing for people with middle incomes, will benefit from $2 billion in additional financing from the Government of Canada to help deliver thousands more homes that people with middle incomes who live and work in B.C. can afford.“All levels of government need to work together to solve the housing crisis,” said Premier David Eby. “With the federal government’s contribution and partnership toward BC Builds, we can help build more homes people can actually afford. That’s good news for our economy and for our future, but most importantly it’s good news for British Columbians looking for a decent place to live.”On Feb. 13, 2024, the Province announced BC Builds, an initiative delivered through BC Housing that leverages government, community and non-profit owned and under-used land to speed up the delivery of housing and help bring costs more in line with what middle-income households earn. All BC Builds projects have a target of middle-income households spending no more than 30% of their income on rent.“Canada needs more homes that the middle class can afford. That’s what today’s historic partnership with British Columbia is all about,” said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “Our investment, through the BC Builds Program, will use public land to create more affordable housing, bring down the cost of construction and ensure that we build more homes faster so that Canadians – from teachers, to nurses, to construction workers – can afford to stay in the communities where they work.”In addition to the $2-billion financing from the Government of Canada, BC Builds is supported through an investment of $950 million from the Province to ensure units are available at below-market rates, as well as $2 billion in provincial low-cost construction financing. The BC Builds team will help streamline approvals for projects seeking federal financing to meet the 12-18-month concept-to-construction BC Builds timeline.BC Builds has established 20 initial sites through partnerships with local governments, First Nations and non-profit organizations to support the development of housing for middle-income households throughout the province.With the federal financing in place and through the 20 initial BC Builds sites, it is anticipated a minimum of between 8,000 and 10,000 homes for people with middle incomes will initially be built over the first five years of the program. The total number of units is expected to grow as more partners and land are secured.“Teachers, nurses, construction workers and other middle-income people need more housing options in B.C., and with several BC Builds sites identified and dozens of interested partners, we are well on our way to getting the additional housing they need built,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “We are in a housing crisis that requires support from all levels of government. BC Builds will ensure that middle-income housing will get built faster and more in line with what households earn.”The Province also announced BC Builds' fourth site, owned by the City of Vancouver, located at 560 Davie St. and 1210 Seymour St. The site will include:\n\tA nine-storey concrete building with 112 new co-operative homes for middle-income households in Vancouver.\n\tWhile the BC Builds program has a requirement that a minimum of 20% of units must rent at 20% below market, the Seymour St. project will better that with at least 30% of units to be rented below market. This additional affordability is possible through cost savings provided by the City, as well as federal financing and provincial grants and financing.\n\tThe building will be located at the corner of Davie and Seymour streets, the last underdeveloped parcel of land in Yaletown. A premium location in downtown Vancouver, the 112 new co-op homes will be located across from Emery Barnes Park near several bus routes.\n\tThe mixed-use proposed project will include co-op homes of studios, one-, two-, and three-bedroom suites, and will be safe, secure and permanently affordable. The building will be designed to “passive house” standards, which have high energy efficiency.\n\tConstruction is expected to begin in summer 2024.\n“Middle-income earners are the economic engine of our city. It’s beneficial to all Vancouverites that they have a place to call home in the city where they work,” said Ken Sim, mayor of Vancouver. “The $2-billion of additional funding from the federal government will allow more affordable homes in our city to be built faster and signals that through the partnership of all levels of government, we can tackle the housing crisis.”The site is in addition to three sites announced on Feb. 13, 2024, comprising more than 400 housing units in the Cowichan Valley, Gibsons and North Vancouver.BC Builds is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has nearly 78,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway throughout B.C., including nearly 8,000 units in Vancouver.\nLearn More:To learn more about BC Builds, visit: www.bcbuildshomes.caTo learn more about how BC Builds works, including funding and financing, visit: https://www.bcbuildshomes.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BCB-Rental-Supply-Program-Framework.pdfTo learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436A map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is available online: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/A backgrounder follows.\n\tAt least 20% of all BC Builds homes will have rents that are at least 20% below market rate for projects in partnership with non-profits and First Nations.\n\tAll BC Builds units have a target of middle-income households spending no more than approximately 30% of their income on rent.\n\tThe rents for BC Builds will not exceed market rent for that community, and will in many cases be below.\n\tAll households living in BC Builds homes are income tested at move-in.\n\tThe income levels vary by community, so homes are within reach for that community’s middle-income households.\n\tBC Builds moves projects from concept to construction in 12-18 months, rather than the typical three to five years.\n\t\tThis will be accomplished by streamlining development processes and by the BC Builds team working with landowners, municipalities, and residential developers to work through and remove barriers. \n\t\n\tBC Builds projects aim to deliver more two-, three- and four-bedroom homes, as many as possible with below-market rents.\n\tProjects owned and operated by non-profit providers mean rents will remain low over time, creating more affordability.",

This project symbolizes our unwavering commitment to providing safe and secure housing for all our members,” said Chief Ron Sam, Songhees Nation. “We are excited to declare that this initiative represents merely the first step in a comprehensive plan aimed at ensuring the well-being and prosperity of our people. The construction of a six-storey residential apartment reflects our dedication to on-reserve housing, a crucial step toward community empowerment. Together, we embark on a path prioritizing the fundamental right of every individual to a place they can call home.”The six-storey apartment building will feature a mix of studio, one- and two-bedroom homes, where residents will pay no more than 30% of their income on rent.“We are taking action to help deliver much-needed housing for members of the Songhees community and I look forward to the positive impact these homes will have on the lives of Songhees residents, and their friends and families, here on their lands,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “This is the first new housing to be built on Songhees land in 17 years, and through our Homes for People plan, our government will continue to support culturally relevant, stable and affordable housing for Indigenous people.”This project is the result of a partnership between the Songhees Nation, the Province, through BC Housing, the federal government, through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), and the Capital Regional District.The homes will be operated by M’akola Housing Society and will be prioritized for Songhees Nation members. The building is expected to be completed in early 2025.“I look forward to seeing the doors open on these new homes, so Indigenous families, elders and individuals can remain in their community with their family and friends,” said Mitzi Dean, MLA for Esquimalt-Metchosin. “I would like to thank our many project partners, including Songhees Nation, M’akola Housing, the federal government and the Capital Region Housing Corporation, for coming together to make this housing project a reality.”This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has nearly 78,000 homes that have been completed or are underway, including approximately 5,500 homes in the Capital Regional District.Funding provided for the project is as follows:\n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, is providing $10 million through the Federal Bilateral Canada Community Housing Initiative.\n\tThe federal government, through CMHC, is providing $9.9 million through the Rapid Housing Initiative (RHI) Cities Stream.\n\tThe Songhees Nation provided the land, which has a value of approximately $2.8 million.\n\tThe Capital Regional District applied to CMHC’s RHI Cities Stream funding under the National Housing Strategy, and has partnered with BC Housing and Songhees Nation on the new rental housing development.\n\tAryze, the developer/builder of the project, is contributing $525,000 of in-kind design services.\nQuotes: Seamus O’Regan, federal minister of Labour and Seniors, on behalf of Sean Fraser, federal minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities – “We need to build all kinds of housing to tackle the housing crisis. Homes that families can afford and meet their unique needs. We’re working with local, regional and Songhees partners to make that a reality in Songhees Nation.” Zac de Vries, chair, Capital Region Housing Corporation –“The Admirals Road project was made possible by a partnership between First Nations, local, provincial and federal governments – an emblematic demonstration of the kind of collaboration we need in order to make meaningful progress in addressing the housing crisis.”Luke Mari, principal, Aryze Developments – “The project at 1502 Admirals Rd. represents a true, layered partnership, where the private sector has teamed up with four distinct governments — Songhees, regional, provincial and federal — to deliver much-needed housing for community members. This building is the epitome of rapid housing, from funding to construction in less than a year. On behalf of our team and our dedicated trade partners, we are honoured to be supporting Songhees Nation in this important, Indigenous-led housing solution.”Quick Facts:\n\tTo help build homes faster and support existing housing, the Province has committed approximately $1.8 billion over the next 10 years to build 3,500 homes on and off reserve through the Building BC: Indigenous Housing Fund, with 1,500 already open or underway.\n\tCanada's National Housing Strategy (NHS) is a 10-year, $82 billion-plus plan that will give more Canadians a place to call home.\n\t\tNHS is built on strong partnerships between the federal, provincial and territorial governments, and continuous engagement with others, including municipalities, Indigenous organizations, and the social and private housing sectors. This includes consultations with Canadians from all walks of life and people with lived experience of housing need.\n\t\tAll NHS investments delivered by the federal, provincial and territorial governments will respect the key principles of NHS that support partnerships, people and communities.\n\t\nLearn More:To learn about B.C.’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for people in British Columbia, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/For the most requested Government of Canada housing information, visit: https://www.canada.ca/en/services/finance/manage/housing.htmlTo find out more about the National Housing Strategy, visit: https://www.placetocallhome.ca/For information about Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, visit: https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/",

    "contents": "KELOWNA – People experiencing homelessness in Kelowna now have access to 60 new indoor spaces with the opening of STEP Place at 759 Crowley Ave.“We recognize the immediate need to bring unhoused people in Kelowna indoors and provide them the care they need,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “That is why the rapid opening of these units is significant as it means more people now have access to a safe and warm place to stay. Through this housing, people experiencing homelessness can be supported as they stabilize and move forward with their lives.”These units are part of the Homeless Encampment Action Response Temporary Housing (HEARTH) program, which is one of the initiatives being implemented under the memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Province and the City of Kelowna. People will begin moving into the units before the end of February 2024. Each unit is outfitted with storage shelving, a bed, dresser, mini-fridge, desk, chair and a heating/cooling unit. The site includes an indoor multi-use common space with a community kitchen.People moving into STEP Place will be mainly from local shelters and ready to take the next step to more independent housing with embedded supports. This will free up shelter spaces for people living in encampments and others experiencing homelessness in the community.“Today marks an important milestone for both previously unhoused individuals and for our community,” said Tom Dyas, mayor of Kelowna. “These 60 units, built in just four months, show how governments and organizations can work quickly to address homelessness challenges. We are grateful to the Province for investing in our community.”STEP Place will be managed by the John Howard Society of Okanagan and Kootenay, an experienced non-profit housing provider. The society will provide services such as daily meals, 24/7 staffing, access to skills training and support navigating the housing system. Individuals moving into these new units will be assessed and matched with appropriate supports. Staff are committed to working respectfully with each person to help them along their own path to housing stability.“Using a trauma-informed, person-centred approach, STEP Place will provide a high-quality therapeutic program designed to help people achieve their housing, employment and health goals,” said Patricia Bacon, executive director of the John Howard Society of Okanagan and Kootenay. “We are excited to be part of this collaboration for the first HEART and HEARTH project for Kelowna.”Under the Homeless Encampment Action Response Teams (HEART) program in Kelowna, Interior Health will also deliver a range of health services to individuals in housing and existing shelters through the establishment of a new Integrated Health Outreach Team known as IHOT. The team's services will include episodic primary care, wound care, medication support, clinical referrals and connections to other health-care services, such as substance-use and mental-health treatment. The incorporation of an Indigenous patient navigator will ensure culturally safe care for all clients.“This outreach team will streamline access to care by connecting with individuals directly in the community, providing them with the services and supports they need, and fostering improved health and well-being for this vulnerable population,” said Susan Brown, Interior Health president and CEO.STEP is an acronym for Supported Transitional [Housing] with Embedded Programming, to signify a step between shelter and permanent housing. These spaces are temporary units offering a safe, warm, and secure place for people to rest and access the support services they need. BC Housing will continue working with the city to identify areas to build new permanent supportive housing.Trailside Transitional Housing, a second 60-unit housing project at 2740 Highway 97 N., is expected to be completed in April 2024.The Province has nearly 78,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway throughout the province, including more than 1,700 homes in Kelowna.Quick Facts:\n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, is providing a total of approximately $5.4 million for STEP Place from the HEARTH program and will also provide annual operating funding.\n\tThe project is on land owned by the City of Kelowna, which will lease the land to the Province for a nominal fee.\n\tThe Province and the City of Kelowna signed an MOU in August 2023 that formalized their commitment to work together to better support people who are unhoused or sheltering in encampments through the HEART and HEARTH programs.\n\tThe HEARTH program enables the rapid development of new shelter and housing options to bring people indoors.\n\tThe HEART program brings together the provincial and local governments, Indigenous partners, health-care agencies and non-profit organizations to quickly assess the needs of people sheltering in encampments and provide rapid access to the supports and services they need to find a home.\nLearn More:To read the MOU, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/BC-MOU_Kelowna_HEART-HEARTH.pdfFor information about the HEART and HEARTH programs, visit:\nhttps://www.bchousing.org/housing-assistance/homelessness-services/HEART-HEARTHTo read the Belonging in BC plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/BelongingStrategy.pdf",

    "contents": "LANGLEY – People will see improvements to regional travel and transit reliability with major upgrades to Highway 1 between 216th and 264th streets.This highway-widening project, which includes high-occupancy vehicle (HOV)/electric vehicle (EV) lanes and a new 232nd Street Interchange, is now out to tender.  “The B.C. government is taking action to relieve traffic congestion for drivers and to add more capacity for sustainable transportation options like public transit through Langley and into the Fraser Valley,” said Rob Fleming, B.C.’s Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “By adding lanes for high-occupancy and electric vehicles, we’re helping to keep goods moving smoothly, while making it easier for people to get to and from work so they can spend more time with family.”Highway 1 is being widened through the Fraser Valley to help relieve traffic congestion and accommodate more sustainable transportation options. A new HOV lane will be added in each direction between the 216th Street and 264th Street interchanges, with the new lanes added toward the median.“Strategic planning and investments in public infrastructure are key elements of the federal government’s efforts to foster growth and enhance connectivity,” said Sean Fraser, federal Minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities. “This project aims to improve safety, ease of travel and sustainability for commuters. The new addition of HOV and EV lanes will promote the transition towards greener forms of highway transportation. This investment will also contribute to Metro Vancouver’s sustainable development, facilitating the efficient exchange of goods and services across the province.”The 232nd Street Interchange is an important community connection for Township of Langley residents, linking Highway 1 to Highway 10. The existing 232nd Street Interchange will be replaced and reconfigured to improve capacity and increase the height clearance over Highway 1. The new crossing will include three-metre-wide multi-use pathways in both directions to tie into the local active-transportation network.This will be the second of three construction contracts for Phase 2 of the Fraser Valley Highway 1 Corridor Improvement Program between 216th and 264th streets. West of 232nd Street, construction is well underway on the new Glover Road crossing over Highway 1, with completion expected by summer 2024. The nearby CPKC Rail overhead will also be replaced with a higher structure.As work progresses on this phase of the Fraser Valley Highway 1 Corridor Improvement Program, accelerated advance work for Phase 3A and 3B through Abbotsford is underway. This involves property acquisition, utility relocation, median soil removal, tree clearing and preloading of soil between 264th Street and Highway 11. A new 264th Street Interchange is also in procurement, with additional major works tenders between 264th Street and Mt. Lehman Road anticipated this spring.The Highway 1 216th to 264th Street Widening Project is valued at $345 million. The Government of Canada is contributing as much as $96.05 million to the project through the New Building Canada Fund, with the remainder of funding from the Province of B.C.Quotes:Dan Coulter, B.C. Minister of State for Infrastructure and Transit, and MLA for Chilliwack – “A wider, more accessible 232nd Street Interchange will anchor this phase of upgrades to Highway 1 as we work to improve travel for people throughout the Fraser Valley. The new 232nd Street Interchange will make for better community connections, and we’re raising the structure to reduce the risk of overpass collisions along Highway 1.”Megan Dykeman, MLA for Langley East – “When completed, these upgrades to the Highway 1 corridor through Langley will greatly improve how people get around in our community. The addition of HOV lanes will make travel by transit more reliable, while the new interchange will make it easier for people to bike or walk, reducing reliance on single-occupancy vehicles.”Learn more: To learn more about the Highway 1 216th to 264th Street widening project, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation-projects/fraser-valley-highway1/highway1-216th-264th-wideningTo learn more about the Fraser Valley Highway 1 Corridor Improvement Program, visit: http://www.gov.bc.ca/fraser-valley-highway1",

    "contents": "VICTORIA – Consulting engineers have been honoured for their work to improve transportation in British Columbia, from rehabilitating a 100-year-old bridge in Terrace to building back better a critical piece of Vancouver Island highway.The winners were announced at the B.C. Transportation Conference for the Association of Consulting Engineering Companies –  British Columbia, held in Vancouver on Thursday, Feb. 15, 2024.Design and contract preparation – structuresThurber Engineering Ltd. and McElhanney Ltd. are sharing the design and contract preparation award for structures for their contribution to fixing a wall that collapsed on Highway 1’s Malahat Tunnel Hill during the November 2021 floods. Temporary repairs led to the reopening of Highway 1 within 18 hours, with continuous two-way traffic four days later. To permanently re-establish a roadway on a steep, unstable slope, the companies designed a new 100-metre-long retaining wall to create better drainage for future extreme weather. Their work also kept traffic moving on this primary route for 35,000 daily commuters.Design and contract preparation – roadsFor improving a road section with local, Indigenous help, R.F. Binnie & Associates won the design and contract preparation award for roads. In April 2018, high waters from Narcosli Creek washed away sections of West Fraser Road, 17 kilometres south of Quesnel. The spring freshet in 2020 caused further damage and reactivated historical slides, which severed five locations on the road, creating a 45-kilometre gravel detour. On time and budget, the contractors realigned a 5.5-kilometre stretch of road through challenging mountainous landscapes, including a 124-metre bridge that crossed the creek. Binnie worked with local Indigenous groups and contractors to create a safer, more climate-resilient road, with wider lanes and shoulders, and roadside barriers.Alternate transportationDesigning a replacement for Skytrain station escalators dating back to 1986 led AECOM Canada Architects Ltd to win the alternate transportation award. The 44 escalators in the Expo line’s original 17 stations were near the end of their service life, with the newest escalators installed in 1990. AECOM’s work aimed to prevent mechanical issues and long-term shutdowns and led to significantly enhanced safety and usability. During the upgrades, the firm created a system to maintain smooth pedestrian traffic flow for thousands of daily transit users.Construction management and supervision servicesThe award for construction management and supervision services went to WSP Canada Inc. for the Old Skeena Bridge No. 473 rehabilitation. When the work giving new life to this 1925-built bridge became significantly more complex than expected, WSP worked with its partners to increase the project’s scope. The contractors were able to open the bridge three months ahead of schedule, allowing it to serve the community during peak summer traffic. WSP’s approach to sustainable practices also preserved the natural habitat and upheld the bridge’s status for traditional First Nations activities.Specialized engineering servicesUrban Systems Ltd. won the specialized engineering services award for the Highway 16 – Terrace Commercial Vehicle Inspection Station. Replacing a decommissioned facility in B.C.’s northwest region where vital trade corridors intersect, the new building features improved technology, a new weigh scale and a covered truck inspection station. Overnight parking and features for active transportation and pedestrians help make the new facility more people friendly, and contractors completed the project ahead of schedule.Transportation planning studiesUrban Systems Ltd. also won the transportation planning studies award for creating Central Okanagan Integrated Transportation Strategy (CO-ITS) in 2020 as a visionary 20-year strategy. The plan responds to the anticipated 36% growth in Central Okanagan by 2040, which will make it B.C.'s fourth-largest regional district. CO-ITS’s particular emphasis on sustainable solutions for a changing climate explored opportunities to intensify land use along Highway 97, the region’s primary goods movement route. It concentrated on road and intersection improvements, transit and regional mobility hubs, and active transportation, including multiple trails and overpasses. Critically, the plan fostered collaboration and integrated diverse perspectives by extensively engaging with Indigenous communities, local governments and BC Transit, in an inclusive approach in line with government priorities.Learn More:For more information about the winners of the 2024 B.C.

This project also couldn’t have happened without the support of Mental Health and Addictions Minister Jennifer Whiteside and local community members.”Located at 1299 Homewood Rd., the site will be known as the HEARTH Village and will have individual units for as many as 40 people to sleep and store their belongings, as well as a shared amenity space and washrooms. An experienced non-profit organization is being retained to operate HEARTH Village. Staff will be on-site 24 hours a day, seven days a week and will provide support services, such as daily meals, access to skills training, and health and community support referrals.“People sheltering outdoors need a safe space to sleep, and through our new Homelessness Encampment Action Response Temporary Housing (HEARTH) program, we’re providing that option along with basic amenities,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “We will continue to work with the City of Campbell River and other municipalities throughout the province to develop more housing options so people in our communities have options to move indoors.”HEARTH Village was a concept started by the City of Campbell River and supported by the Table of Partners, which included the Downtown Campbell River Business Improvement Association and service providers. The Province, through BC Housing, is providing capital costs and funding, which is currently being determined. The City of Campbell River is providing the land for the project, as well as funding the civil works and site preparation costs. It is expected that HEARTH Village could open by mid-2024.“Campbell River has an urgent need to serve people who are experiencing homelessness and to help address encampments and associated challenges in our community,” said Kermit Dahl, mayor of Campbell River. “In keeping with city council’s commitment to community health and safety, our partnership with the Province will reduce some of the challenges our community is experiencing and will provide new, safe housing options.”The project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has nearly 78,000 homes delivered or underway, including approximately 280 in Campbell River.Learn More:For details about the project, including public engagement, visit: http://www.letstalkhousingbc.ca/campbell-river-homewood-roadFor information about the HEART and HEARTH programs, visit: https://www.bchousing.org/housing-assistance/homelessness-services/HEART-HEARTHA map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is available online: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing",

    "contents": "VANCOUVER – Construction is underway on the seven-storey, 123-unit Vienna House project, creating affordable and sustainable homes for individuals, seniors, people living with disabilities, and families in Vancouver.  “This affordable-housing project is providing individuals and families with 123 safe and environmentally responsive homes, so people can stay in the community they know,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “Our Homes for People action plan is all about increasing housing supply faster, so everyone can find a home that suits their needs, and it is partner projects like this that are helping us reach our housing goals.”The project at 2001 Stainsbury Ave. is the result of a partnership between BC Housing, City of Vancouver and More than a Roof Housing Society. Vienna House will combine shelter, low-income and market rentals to provide a mix of housing options, including 29 studio units, 37 one-bedroom units, 35 two-bedroom units, 16 three-bedroom units and six four-bedroom units.Ten per cent of the units will be accessible for people living with disabilities and all units will be adaptable.“Thank you to Vancouver for making the land available for Vienna House, so we can bring 123 much-needed rental homes to Vancouver,” said Adrian Dix, MLA for Vancouver-Kingsway. “I know these will make a huge difference in the lives of the families and people who move in, and look forward to seeing more homes like these built in B.C., so more people can access homes they can afford.”Vienna House is a partnership between the cities of Vancouver and Vienna, Austria, and includes a research agreement with University of British Columbia (UBC). The cities and researchers are collaborating to make innovations in the sustainable design of affordable housing.Vienna House will achieve significant sustainability goals. Using mass timber and prefabricated wall, floor and ceiling components will reduce emissions during construction, store carbon and contribute to diverting 75% of construction waste from landfills. Achieving Passive House certification will represent an annual energy-use reduction of approximately 52%. Using electric appliances and hot water will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 90%. Research partners at UBC will build a digital twin of the building to test and optimize components and systems, such as passive airflow.“Vienna House embodies our commitment to innovative, sustainable solutions in tackling Vancouver's housing affordability crisis,” said Ken Sim, mayor of Vancouver. “Through strong partnerships and a focus on energy-efficient design, we're not just building homes, but shaping a future where affordable living is a reality for all Vancouverites.”Vienna House will be located in the heart of a vibrant, family-friendly neighbourhood in East Vancouver. Residents will be a short walk from services, schools, public transit, Trout Lake Community Centre and park, and the Commercial Drive entertainment district.“Vienna House will benefit generations of British Columbians as a model to test Design for Disassembly strategy,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “By designing for both modular component replacement, as well as end-of-life disassembly rather than demolition, means that we can recycle and reuse many of the components of the building, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Through collaboration with UBC, this approach will help us protect our environment by using sustainable building components, yield significant reductions in climate pollution, as well as costs for residents.”More than a Roof Housing Society will own and operate the building on a 60-year lease from the City of Vancouver.“More Than a Roof is proud to partner on this innovative affordable-housing project,” said Lee Anne Michayluk, COO, More than a Roof Housing Society. “Access to world-class communities that are affordable, climate resilient and promote social sustainability through thoughtful design should be available to everyone.”Construction is expected to be complete by fall 2025, with residents moving in shortly thereafter.The project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has nearly 78,000 homes delivered or underway, including nearly 8,000 homes in Vancouver.Quick Facts:\n\tBC Housing is providing approximately $22.2 million though two funding programs: Building BC: Community Housing Fund ($13.84 million) and a Cost Pressure Grant ($8.36 million).\n\tThe City of Vancouver will support the project with more than $13 million in combined land equity and waivers. \n\tApproximately 20% of the units, 25 homes, will be rented at shelter rates for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness.\n\tApproximately 50% of the units, 61 homes, will have rent geared to income.\n\tApproximately 30% of the units, 37 homes, will be affordable market rentals, tied to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation average market rent.\nLearn More:To learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436A map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is available here: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for people in British Columbia, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/To learn more about Vienna House and the partnerships involved in this project, visit: https://viennahouse.ca",

    "contents": "VANCOUVER – People experiencing homelessness in Vancouver will have access to safe and secure places to stay with the addition of two shelters in the community.“These additional shelter beds will give people experiencing homelessness in Vancouver supports and a safe place to stay,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “We are committed to delivering more supports through our Belonging in BC homelessness plan, so that people have a roof over their head. The addition of these shelter beds means that more people sheltering outdoors can have safe and warm places to stay with connections to appropriate supports.”Located at 325 Main St., a new shelter has temporarily opened, providing 20 beds that will be available every night for people sheltering outdoors. People staying at the shelter will also be able to access personalized help, connecting them to referrals and support services.“These shelter spaces are much needed for people experiencing homelessness in Vancouver,” said Joan Phillip, MLA for Vancouver-Mount Pleasant. “Access to these beds and supports is necessary, so people remain safe and healthy. The resources that will be available to them will aid them in their recovery.” Operated by Lookout Housing and Health Society on a short-term lease until May 31, 2024, the shelter will help address the immediate shelter need in the community, while other housing options are underway. The Province, through BC Housing, is providing approximately $350,000 to operate the space until the lease expires.“Unfortunately, there is a tremendous need for additional shelter beds in the region and across the city of Vancouver,” said Shayne Williams, CEO of Lookout. “Lookout is extremely pleased to have the opportunity to bring more people in from the inclement weather, while also furthering services options for specialized populations, including women and transgender individuals.”In addition to this shelter, the Province, through BC Housing, has purchased a building located at 1726 E. Hastings St. Renovations to the property are underway and as many as 40 additional shelter beds will be available by the end of 2024. Through the Supportive Housing Fund, the Province is providing approximately $7.4 million to purchase and renovate the building.The Province, through BC Housing, is working to expand shelter capacity in Vancouver through these projects and other investments. While shelters provide immediate relief to people experiencing homelessness, these are not a long-term solution to the homelessness crisis. Through the Belonging in BC homelessness plan, it is the government’s goal to move people into permanent, stable housing.Since 2017, the Province has nearly 78,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway, including nearly 8,000 in Vancouver.Learn More:To read Belonging in BC plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/BelongingStrategy.pdfTo learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for people in British Columbia, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/",

    "contents": "NORTH VANCOUVER – The Province has launched BC Builds to lower construction costs, speed up timelines, and deliver more homes that middle-income people who live and work in B.C. can afford.BC Builds is a new initiative that leverages government, community and non-profit owned and underused land with $2 billion in low-cost financing and a commitment of $950 million for the overall program.“Anyone looking for a place to live knows how hard it is – even if you make a decent salary there are not enough rental homes people can afford,” said Premier David Eby. “The private sector alone has not been able to deliver the homes middle-class people in B.C. need. That’s why we’re taking action through BC Builds to deliver lower-cost middle-income homes, faster, so the people who keep our communities working – like teachers, nurses, and construction workers – can find homes they can afford in the communities they love.”  Inflation, high interest rates, and the cost of land and construction have driven up costs and rent in B.C. and across the country, and not enough middle-income housing is being built as a result. Too many homes are out of reach for middle-income earners and people are spending more than half of their household income on housing, pushing people out of communities, and making labour shortages worse.Supported by grant funding and financing from the B.C. government, through BC Housing, BC Builds is designed to deliver through challenging market conditions to bring down building costs, get more projects started, and build more homes that fit into middle-income budgets. The program will focus on rental housing first with rents reflecting local conditions and determined on a community-by-community basis. This means more households will find below-market rent and spend less than 30% of their income on rent.“Too many middle-class families are struggling to find a place to live that they can afford, and that’s holding people and our economy back,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “BC Builds is designed to meet this moment, overcome challenging market conditions, and deliver lower-cost rental homes for the people who deliver the services we rely on, and drive our economy forward – so they can build good lives here and thrive.”BC Builds works in partnership with non-profits, local governments, First Nations and the development sector to identify available underused land, provide financing and funding, and deliver projects that create more homes and help bring costs more in line with what middle-income households earn.BC Builds details include:\n\tAt least 20% of all BC Builds homes will have rents that are at least 20% below market rate for projects in partnership with non-profits and First Nations.\n\tAll BC Builds units have a target of middle-income households spending no more than approximately 30% of their income on rent.\n\tThe rents for BC Builds will not exceed market rent for that community, and will in many cases be below.  \n\tAll households living in BC Builds homes are income tested at move-in.\n\tThe income levels vary by community, so homes are within reach for that community’s middle-income households.\n\tBC Builds projects aim to deliver more two-, three- and four-bedroom homes, as many as possible with below-market rents.\n\tProjects owned and operated by non-profit providers mean rents will remain low over time, creating more affordability.\nBC Builds uses lower government borrowing rates to offer lower-cost financing and grants to bring down construction costs. The program also works with municipalities, landowners, residential builders and housing operators to move projects from concept to construction within 12 to 18 months, compared to the current of average of three to five years. This will be accomplished by streamlining municipal development processes and by working with landowners, municipalities and residential builders to remove barriers.BC Builds is designed to grow. In addition to the sites detailed below, thousands of BC Builds homes will continue to move at an expedited pace as projects are approved over the next three years, with some estimated to be under construction as early as summer 2024. More than 20 initial BC Builds sites have been identified on government, First Nations, non-profit and community-owned land. BC Builds is seeking new partners and landowners who want to build housing on underused land or above new community buildings.The following three projects are examples of BC Builds:\n\tA site owned by the City of North Vancouver, located at 225 East Second St., being developed by non-profit Catalyst, has development approvals for the following:\n\t\tAn 18-storey mass timber building that will include 180 units affordable for middle-income households in North Vancouver.\n\t\tA minimum of 20% of units must rent at 20% below market, with a goal of delivering even more units at below-market rates.\n\t\tThe building will be located with the North Shore Neighbourhood House, which provides an extensive range of community services, including 37 child care spaces, child-development support programming for 250 children experiencing development delays, food programs, wellness and recreation activities, and youth and seniors’ programs.\n\t\tThe project is located beside a new BC Housing project that will deliver 89 affordable homes, set to open in late 2025.\n\t\n\tA site owned by Cowichan Tribes, located at 222 Cowichan Way in Duncan on reserve land is being developed by Khowutzun Development LLP. It has development approvals for the following:\n\t\tA four-to-six-storey wood-frame building, which will include 199 units for middle-income people and families living in the Cowichan Valley.\n\t\tA minimum of 20% of units must rent at 20% below market, with a goal of delivering even more units at below-market rates.\n\t\tNew governance headquarters for the Cowichan Tribes.\n\t\tSpace for Indigenous businesses.\n\t\n\tA site owned by the Town of Gibsons, located at 571 Shaw Rd., is being developed by non-profit New Commons and will be operated by the Sunshine Coast Affordable Housing Society. It has development approvals for the following:\n\t\tA four-storey wood-frame building, which will contain 33 homes ranging from studios to three-bedroom homes.\n\t\tA minimum of 20% of units must rent at 20% below market, with a goal of delivering more units at below-market rates.\n\t\tThe building will also include an early child care centre with 24 child care spaces, encompassing a pre-school daycare and before-and-after school care for eight children.\n\t\nBC Builds is part of the Province’s Homes for People action plan. Launched in spring 2023, the plan builds on historic action to deliver housing since 2017 and sets out further actions to deliver the homes people need faster, while creating more vibrant communities throughout B.C. Actions to speed up the delivery of housing in B.C. include reining in short-term rentals, turning land near transit hubs into housing, increasing small-scale-multi-unit homes, fixing restrictive zoning rules and cutting wait times at the Residential Tenancy Branch among other initiatives.BC Builds is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has nearly 78,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway throughout B.C., including more than 750 units in North Vancouver.Quick Fact:\n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, provides a range of affordable rental housing and rental subsidy programs that serve low-, moderate, and middle-income households.\nLearn More:To learn more about the BC Builds program, visit: https://bcbuildshomes.caTo learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436A map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is available online: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/Four backgrounders follow.Linda Buchanan, mayor of City of North Vancouver –“We have experienced significant job growth across the North Shore. But the people who keep our economy moving do not have housing options within their reach, forcing them to commute from far parts of the region. Thanks to this investment, the people who work here can become our neighbours.”Silas White, mayor of Gibsons – “The Town of Gibsons is thrilled and honoured to be part of the launch of BC Builds. Affordable housing is the most critical challenge in our community, so we appreciate the provincial government’s support and collaboration to add another 33 units, as well as a child care program, to the Sunshine Coast Affordable Housing Society’s first 40 units of housing at Christenson Village. The 73 units, plus child care, will go a long way to addressing our housing and workforce needs.”Xtli’li ye’ Lydia Hwitsum, Chief of the Cowichan Tribes – “Cowichan Tribes has been working hard to develop innovative partnerships to meet the substantial urgent housing needs in our community. One example is our current project to build two beautiful mixed-use buildings – designed to provide 199 apartment suites and ample green space for residents. I am pleased to see the provincial government stepping up with the BC Builds program and partnering with us to get these homes built.”Jodee Dick, CEO, Khowutzun Development Corporation – “Khowutzun Development Corporation is proud to be developing this exciting project with Cowichan Tribes and BC Builds, harmonizing the paths of industry, government, and our Nation into one true path of reconciliation is our goal at Khowutzun Development.”Jill Atkey, CEO, BC Non-Profit Housing Association –“BC Builds is another historic investment into much-needed workforce housing, with the Province leveraging community-held assets toward a supply solution. What’s more, we’re excited that there is a clearly defined role to for the community housing sector because the long-term affordability achieved by our sector simply can’t be matched.”Tim Heimpel, lead steward for the Health Sciences Association; respiratory therapist, Lions Gate Hospital – “I’ve seen the increasing cost of housing first-hand; our small, niche department has lost two amazing respiratory therapists to other provinces in the last six months alone; many other departments have been affected similarly. Having affordable, stable housing close to your workplace not only helps with retention and recruitment; but those living close by are much more likely to pick up last-minute shifts, which eases the burden of staff hospital-wide, thereby creating an overall better work environment.”Carolyn Whitzman, adjunct professor and housing researcher, University of Ottawa – “It is great to see the B.C. government scaling up non-market and Indigenous affordable housing on government land. Based on previous successful programs in the 1970s and 1980s, we know these homes will maintain affordability over time.”\n\tAt least 20% of all BC Builds homes will have rents that are at least 20% below market rate for projects in partnership with non-profits and First Nations.\n\tAll BC Builds units have a target of middle-income households spending no more than approximately 30% of their income on rent.\n\tAll households living in BC Builds homes are income tested at move-in.\n\tThe income levels vary by community, so homes are within reach for that community’s middle-income households.\n\tBC Builds projects aim to deliver more two-, three- and four-bedroom homes, as many as possible with below market rents.\n\tProjects owned and operated by non-profit providers mean rents will remain low over time, creating more affordability.\n\tAs the private sector alone has not been able to build housing within reach for middle income households, BC Builds delivers housing for households at the top end of current BC Housing program income eligibility and beyond, to meet the growing need for more housing for people in these middle-income ranges.\n\tBC Builds picks up where existing BC Housing programs leave off. For example, current eligibility for the Community Housing Fund, which is at the top end of BC Housing programs, is for income ranges from $84,780 for studio/one bedroom and $134,140 for two-plus beds.\n\tBC Builds is designed to create housing that is affordable for household incomes from $84,780 to $131,950 for a studio or one-bedroom home, or $134,410 to $191,910 for a two-bedroom home or larger. This will vary by community, to reflect local incomes. The upper end of the income range will only be applicable in the highest-income communities for three- and four-bedroom units.\n\tThose with lower incomes will be prioritized for below-market units.\n\tPeople who earn less than their community middle-income range annually will be eligible to live in a BC Builds studio or one-bedroom home. However, they may be better served by BC Housing’s affordable rental housing and rental subsidy programs that serve low- and moderate-income households.\n\tPeople with income levels above the local thresholds will be ineligible to live in BC Builds housing.\n\tThe program will use a formula-based approach to determine the rental rates within communities using an appraisal of purpose-built rental units within the community and the average income range of people currently living in the community.\nThe Province, through BC Housing, has established partnership opportunities with 20 governments and organizations that are working with BC Builds to build homes for people faster:\n\tChurch of the Nazarene, City of Langley\n\tCity of Kamloops\n\tCity of Kelowna\n\tCity of Langley\n\tCity of North Vancouver\n\tCity of Port Alberni \n\tCity of Vancouver\n\tDistrict of Squamish\n\tKhowutzen Development Corporation (Cowichan Tribes)\n\tNelson and District Chamber of Commerce\n\tResort Municipality of Whistler\n\tSacred Waters (and the respective Nations working closely together: Katzie, Kwantlen, Semiahmoo)\n\tSouthside Community Church, Burnaby \n\tDistrict of Elkford\n\tTown of Gibsons\n\tTown of Ladysmith\n\tTownship of Langley \n\tc̓išaaʔatḥ (Tsehaht) Nation\n\tUniversity of Victoria\n\tUniversity of British Columbia \nThe Province, through BC Housing, is working with government, non-profit, and community landowners to identify additional underused properties that can be developed or redeveloped into rental housing through BC Builds.The Province acknowledges its commitment to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act, as well as the obligation to consult and co-operate with First Nations regarding the use and disposition of underutilized provincial land that may be identified as potential BC Builds projects. The Ministry of Housing and BC Housing will continue to ensure this obligation is met.Step 1 – Connect and support land partners and home buildersLandowners can find a development partner on their own or source one through the BC Builds website. The BC Builds housing development opportunities page will be launched in the coming weeks, with sites already zoned for housing development. Property owners looking for a developer/builder and/or operating partner will be listed for residential homebuilders and housing operators to review and submit a proposal to develop and/or operate rental housing on the site.BC Builds will facilitate partnership agreements and lease terms between landowners, builders and operators and support the evaluation of proposals.Step 2 – Streamline the approval processOnce a partnership agreement has been established, BC Builds will work with municipal and provincial approvers to accelerate permitting, building and operation of housing.The BC Builds team will work with landowners, municipalities and residential developers to remove barriers.Step 3 – Provide low-interest financing and grantsBC Builds offers low-interest construction financing to reduce the cost of construction of eligible projects.As needed, BC Builds will provide a maximum grant of $225,000 per unit to non-profits and First Nations development corporations to achieve a minimum of 20% of units with rents 20% below market.For eligible groups that own land and have an initial concept, but need additional financial support to advance their project, pre-development loans are available.",

    "contents": "PENTICTON – People experiencing or at risk of homelessness in Penticton, including Indigenous people, are moving into 54 new homes with recovery-focused cultural supports.“We know that supportive homes with culturally safe environments are fundamental to breaking the cycle of homelessness,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “Through our Homes for People action plan, the unique supports offered at snpaʔx̌təntn will ensure that residents’ cultural needs are met throughout their recovery journey.”Located at 3240 Skaha Lake Rd., the new building has been named snpaʔx̌təntn [sin-pow_h-tan-tn], which means “a healing place” in Nsyilxcən, the language spoken by the Syilx peoples. Also known as Healing House, this supportive housing provides Indigenous-focused and culturally safe supports for people who want to live in an environment free from alcohol and substance use in their recovery journey.“The journey that Ooknakane Friendship Centre, ASK Wellness, BC Housing and the Penticton Indian Band have forged, nurtured and grown is a testament to the challenging work required toward advancing reconciliation on the traditional and ancestorial lands of the Okanagan people,” said Shauna Fox, executive director of Ooknakane Friendship Centre. “snpa?xtentn is a model of how we begin the process.”ASK Wellness Society, in partnership with Ooknakane Friendship Centre (OFC), is operating the building. Staff are on site 24/7 to provide supports, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, alcohol and drug counselling, and culturally driven health- and wellness-support services.“On behalf of our Band Council and the Penticton Band Community, we congratulate ASK Wellness Society on this amazing achievement,” said Chief Greg Gabriel of the Penticton Indian Band. “I would also like to recognize and acknowledge the wonderful partners who were also instrumental in what we are witnessing today. This amazing and much-needed supportive housing facility wouldn’t be possible without the hard work and co-operation of all those involved.”The four-storey building has 52 studio homes and two one-bedroom units for couples who are on their recovery journey together. Three of the units are fully accessible. Each unit has its own bathroom, kitchenette and basic furnishings. Residents started moving into the building in August 2023, with 36 units currently occupied. Indigenous people are being prioritized in the resident-selection process.“We are honoured to partner with OFC to create a culturally safe and recovery-focused supportive housing program, which is one of the first of its kind in the province,” said Bob Hughes, executive officer of ASK Wellness Society. “By creating a mosaic of supportive and affordable housing in Penticton, we further complement the existing housing programs and broaden the options for people who are living without homes.”Local Indigenous artists also contributed to the building, providing commissioned artwork through the OFC to further incorporate the Syilx culture into the building.The Province, through BC Housing, provided approximately $15.9 million to the project through the Building BC: Supportive Housing Fund and will provide an annual operating subsidy of approximately $1.8 million.This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway, including approximately 280 homes in Penticton.Quotes:Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs – “As the president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, I am pleased and excited to support the leadership of Ooknakane Friendship Centre and the partnership of ASK Wellness Society, BC Housing and the Penticton Indian Band. This work is very important in serving the housing needs of those in recovery.”Roly Russell, MLA for Boundary-Similkameen and Parliamentary Secretary for Rural Development –“Residents of the South Okanagan understand the value of providing safe and stable living spaces for vulnerable people with the supports they need to succeed and help break the cycle of homelessness. This is one more step to help support the community, taken in partnership.  This 'Healing House' will offer a comfortable, safe place for Indigenous people to live right here in Penticton and provide them with the full supports they need for healthier living.”Julius Bloomfield, mayor of Penticton –“The addition of snpaʔx̌təntn to the continuum of housing in Penticton is an example of the power of partnerships. Recovery-based and Indigenous-focused, these homes are another needed and welcome step for those on the journey of recovery. We look forward to developing resources to assist more people going forward.”Learn More:For more information about snpaʔx̌təntn, visit: https://letstalkhousingbc.ca/penticton-3240-skahaTo learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436A map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is available here: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for people in British Columbia, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/",

Our government is proud to work alongside Snuneymuxw First Nation on this project and we will continue to work with Indigenous partners to build on- and off-reserve housing.”La’lum’utul, which means “care for one another,” will consist of two wood-frame fourplexes. The new development will be intended for families and individuals with low and moderate incomes. There will be a mix of two-, three- and four-bedroom units.“Our partnership with the National Housing Co-Investment Fund represents an important step in addressing the urgent need for housing in our community,” said Chief Mike Wyse of Snuneymuxw First Nation. “We are dedicated to identifying housing solutions that meet the needs of our members and breathe life into our way of being.”The project is the result of a partnership between Snuneymuxw First Nation, the Province through BC Housing, and the Government of Canada through the Canada Mortgage Housing Association (CMHC). The building will be operated by Snuneymuxw First Nation. This project is expected to be complete in 2024.“Indigenous communities in British Columbia deserve access to safe and affordable housing,” said Jonathan Wilkinson, federal minister of Energy and Natural Resources, on behalf of Sean Fraser, federal minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities. “Through the National Housing Co-Investment Fund, the federal government is investing in both affordable new homes for Indigenous peoples and to improve the quality of life for the people who need it most. These kinds of investments transform our communities and will give residents a true sense of belonging and a safe, secure, culturally appropriate place to call home.”This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government.

    "meetingType": "Office of the PremierMinistry of Housing",
    "contents": "COQUITLAM – Homes in two housing co-operatives in Coquitlam will be protected with the first acquisition from the Province’s Rental Protection Fund. “Far too many renters live in fear that their homes will be sold out from under them,” said Premier David Eby. “That’s why we created the Rental Protection Fund to defend people’s homes against profit-seeking speculators like big real estate investment corporations, and preserve safe, secure and affordable homes for generations to come. This landmark acquisition protects 290 affordable homes in the heart of Coquitlam, ensuring people can continue living in the community they helped build.”The Rental Protection Fund is contributing as much as $71 million toward the Community Land Trust of B.C. that will leverage a total of $125 million to buy two housing co-operatives in Coquitlam:\n\tthe Tri-Branch Co-op, made up of 169 homes at 2860 Packard Ave.; and\n\tthe Garden Court Co-op, made up of 121 homes at 2865 Packard Ave.\n“In the midst of a housing crisis, it is critical to preserve these affordable homes for the seniors, families and individuals who have made these co-ops their community,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “The Rental Protection Fund is part of our Homes for People plan that addresses the housing crisis through strong action by preserving affordable housing where it already exists and by delivering more homes within reach for people.”The land trust will own the properties and the co-ops will continue to be self-managed by their respective member boards. The funding from the Rental Protection Fund will support the land purchase and necessary building upgrades.“The residents of Tri-Branch and Garden Court Co-ops can now have peace of mind that the homes they have lived in for many years in the community they know, are secure for them and their families for the future, thanks to the Rental Protection Fund,” said Fin Donnelly, MLA for Coquitlam-Burke Mountain. “The purchase of these co-ops secures housing for the people living here and relieves the housing market by keeping 290 units in the rental supply stock here in Coquitlam.”The land trust assessed members’ incomes and set new housing charges at no more than 30% of people’s incomes. This ensures members can continue to afford their housing charges, while ensuring the co-op can cover its operational and maintenance expenses.“The impact of the Rental Protection Fund can already be seen and felt – and these are just the first of thousands of homes that will grow our community housing sector, while freeing up capital that can be redeployed into new supply,” said Katie Maslechko, CEO of the Rental Protection Fund. “This is a transformative model to address the housing crisis that is already delivering results – enacting real change both quickly and effectively by preserving attainable housing for those at risk of losing their housing security.”The Tri-Branch and Garden Court co-ops were created in 1981 with a 41-year land lease that expired in October 2022. After the lease expired, the co-ops were in lease-payment arrears and had incurred debt, putting the co-ops’ future at risk.“Community Land Trust is proud to celebrate this milestone achievement, enabling us to save and preserve 290 co-op homes in Coquitlam,” said Tiffany Duzita, executive director, Community Land Trust. “The investment made by the Rental Protection Fund and the City of Coquitlam makes it possible for us to protect these homes and the affordability they provide to their members today and in the future.”The $500-million Rental Protection Fund provides one-time capital grants to non-profit housing organizations so they can buy affordable residential rental buildings and co-operatives listed for sale. This protects the people who are living there and safeguarding the units for the long term.“The sites on Packard Avenue have provided affordable co-operative housing for more than 40 years, and today’s funding announcement means that 290 households who love their home will be able to stay in our community,” said Richard Stewart, mayor of Coquitlam. “The city is proud to have contributed $5.8 million to ensure that this important non-market housing is protected and preserved in Coquitlam.”The Rental Protection Fund has approved funding to preserve nearly 700 homes throughout the Province that will be announced in the coming months, with thousands of additional homes under funding consideration.Quotes:Jill Atkey, CEO, BC Non-Profit Housing Association, Rental Protection Fund board member –“We are absolutely thrilled to see a vision become reality by securing the affordability of 290 homes. Because the assets will now be held by the community, affordability today means affordability forever. We look forward to many similar announcements of non-profit acquisitions in the coming months and years.”Margaret Pfoh, CEO, Aboriginal Housing Management Association, Rental Protection Fund board member –“The Rental Protection Fund model is envied across Canada as an innovative program that protects precious affordable rental stock from being privately purchased and converted into units that most of the population can’t afford to live in. Housing is the foundation of well-being, and we are thankful that B.C. has taken the bold step of establishing this fund with Indigenous inclusion at the table.”Mary Raffan, president, Garden Court Housing Co-op –“Our tenacious co-op board has worked tirelessly for the past decade on a solution to save our housing co-op. Today, we can finally have peace, knowing our homes are safe and secure for years to come.”Jewels Cressman, president, Tri-Branch Housing Co-op –“Today, we celebrate the end of a very long period of fear and uncertainty among our members about having a place to call home. Our hearts are overflowing with gratitude for the tireless efforts of all those involved in the collaborative effort that enabled Community Land Trust to purchase the two properties and save our homes.”Brian Cochrane, business manager, International Union of Operating Engineers Local 115 –“We are happy to see the sale of Garden Court and Tri-Branch. This transaction meets the needs of our pension plan, but more importantly is a great example of the impact our union has made working alongside government and non-profits to preserve affordable housing and enrich the communities we live and work in.”Quick Facts:\n\tThe buildings are being purchased together for $125 million, including renewal and acquisition costs, and will be owned by the Community Land Trust of B.C.\n\tThe Rental Protection Fund has committed an equity contribution of as much as $224,000 per home, or as much as $64.9 million, to protect the homes and preserve the co-op tenure. \n\tA $6.5-million renewal grant from the Rental Protection Fund and $2.9-million forgivable loan from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation will support building renewal costs.\n\tBecause the Community Land Trust B.C. is a non-profit charity, the Province is able to waive the $4.2 million in property transfer taxes.\n\tThe Community Land Trust and co-ops are contributing $3.4 million in equity.\nLearn More:For information about the Rental Protection Fund, visit: https://rentalprotectionfund.ca",

    "title": "More wheelchair-accessible taxis will help people connect with communities",
    "resolutionId": null,
    "meetingType": "Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure",
    "contents": "VICTORIA – People who rely on wheelchair-accessible taxis to get to appointments and connect with their communities will have more options as the Province continues to support the increased presence of accessible taxis on the road.Applications are now open for the Passenger Transportation Accessibility Program through the second round of funding.“Building a better, stronger future for all British Columbians means making it easier for everyone to get where they need to go,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “Everyone deserves the peace of mind that they will be able to get to their doctor’s appointment, be able to go to a concert or join their friends for dinner across town without worrying about a getting a taxi home. Supporting taxi operators to get more wheelchair-accessible vehicles on the road means that the people who count on these inclusive, accessible options are able to access the services they need.”People who depend on accessible taxis often experience longer wait times or lack of service. To address this, the Province developed the funding program in 2023 to help make accessible taxis more available by offsetting the costs that taxi companies and owner-operators face in providing wheelchair-accessible vehicles. This year’s expanded program funding will build on the success of last year’s grants by providing further incentives for taxi companies and drivers to invest in accessible vehicles.“The industry is answering the call to provide better service for people with accessibility needs and this funding will remove barriers – both for riders, and for the people who make this their livelihood,” said Dan Coulter, Minister of State for Infrastructure and Transit. “This advances the Province’s commitment made under the Accessible British Columbia Act to improve accessibility standards in transportation. It also helps the industry meet the needs of clients and makes getting around easier and safer for everyone.”As much as $7.8 million is available for this round of funding under the program. Funding will partially subsidize eligible applicants for costs related to vehicle maintenance, converting an existing vehicle, purchasing a converted vehicle, or purchasing a new vehicle and converting it. This year’s funding will also offer rebates to offset the higher costs of fuel and insurance that operators of accessible vehicles face. To support applicants, this year’s application period was extended from four to six weeks and will close on March 3, 2024. Funding for the program comes from revenues collected from the per-trip fee that came into effect in September 2019 to offset the regulatory costs of ride-hailing operations and support accessible transportation.Unlike ride-hailing companies, taxi companies are required, as part of their operating licence, to reserve a portion of their fleet for accessible vehicles.Quotes:Susie Chant, Parliamentary Secretary for Accessibility –“Everyone benefits when our communities are inclusive and when all people have access to transportation. We’re working hard to remove barriers for people with disabilities and this funding to taxi companies and owner-operators shows that a more inclusive and accessible B.C. for all is possible when we work together.”Mohan Kang, president, B.C. Taxi Association –“Meeting the needs of our clients is important. With this funding, we will be able to support more people who rely on accessible vehicles. Having this funding to keep up with the costs of operating these vehicles will ensure more drivers across the province get behind the wheel of an accessible vehicle.”Carolyn Bauer, spokesperson, Vancouver Taxi Association –“The Passenger Transportation Accessibility Program has made it easier for our drivers here in Vancouver to serve people that rely on accessible vehicles. This round of funding will make it easier for the drivers of accessible taxis to continue to do this important work, or for more drivers to adapt their vehicles so we can meet the needs of everyone.”Neil Belanger, CEO, BC Aboriginal Network of Disability Services –“Barriers to accessibility shouldn’t stop people from living an active life. This provincial program supporting the taxi industry ensures more people across British Columbia can be active members of their community by putting additional accessible vehicles on the road.”  Learn More:To view more details about funding eligibility, visit:\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/funding-engagement-permits/funding-grants/passenger-transportation-accessibility-program#:~:text=Fuel%20costs-,Overview,passengers%20who%20rely%20on%20them",

    "resolutionId": null,
    "meetingType": "Ministry of Housing",
    "contents": "VICTORIA – More renters with low to moderate incomes will be able to get financial support as the Province provides additional funding to BC Rent Bank to help people sustain their housing when faced with an unanticipated financial challenge.“We know that people are feeling the impacts of high rents and inflation, and that’s making it hard for them to pay their bills and rent,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “When people are faced with an unanticipated financial challenge, BC Rent Bank is there to help stabilize them. For many people in B.C., this funding can mean the difference between having a safe home or losing it.”The Province is investing nearly $11 million in additional funding to BC Rent Bank to continue to help people maintain their homes in times of immediate financial need. This funding has the potential to support as many as 20,000 renters through unforeseen financial challenges. BC Rent Bank will extend these funds to regional rent banks that work with renters and provide financial assistance and support services to them.“Our government has taken strong actions to build increased renter protections and supports throughout the province,” said Spencer Chandra Herbert, premier’s liaison for renters and MLA for Vancouver West-End. “This new funding will provide ease and peace of mind for people facing housing disruption due to growing economic demands across various aspects of their lives.”Rent banks are a resource to prevent evictions, stabilize housing and support renters during unexpected interruptions to income that jeopardize their housing. The interest-free loans can be applied to their rent or essential utilities, or toward a deposit or first month's rent, for tenants who have secured housing but are unable to pay these requirements.“During these times of economic crisis that affect every Canadian one way or another, it’s both refreshing and inspiring that organizations like BC Rent Bank are there to help those who are struggling,” said Kieran Sabo, a rent bank user. “It reminds us that there are still those who help people simply for the sake of helping people. And in this case, that help meant retaining my housing.”BC Rent Bank is a project of Vancity Community Foundation and supported by the Government of B.C. It is the agency that provides support and funding to B.C.’s provincewide rent bank network.Quotes:Melissa Giles, managing director, BC Rent Bank –“We’re incredibly grateful for the continued financial support by the Government of B.C. This funding will further strengthen and enhance the provincewide network that was established as a result of the funding provided in 2019. Most importantly, we know struggling renters will be helped to stay housed during these challenging economic times.”Genesa Greening, CEO, Vancity Community Foundation –“At the Vancity Community Foundation, our mission is to work with communities to create the economic, social and environmental conditions to collectively thrive, and key to this is how the BC Rent Bank supports renters who face sudden emergencies putting their housing at risk. The Government of B.C.’s renewed investment in the Rent Bank says a lot about their commitment to renters and we are grateful for their support.”Quick Facts:\n\tThe additional funding of $11 million builds on a $10-million investment made by the Province in 2018-19.\n\tRent banks provide financial assistance to renters.\n\tThey also provide or co-ordinate connections to other services, such as financial literacy and debt relief, government benefits and housing supports, landlord mediation, physical needs, such as food and clothing, and referrals that support physical, mental and emotional well-being.\n\tA BC Rent Bank housing survey in 2021 determined that rent-bank assistance increased housing stability and prevented eviction for nearly all rent bank users who responded to the survey. \n\tB.C became the first province to provide 100% rent-bank coverage throughout the province in 2021.\nLearn More:To find the list of communities that are served by BC Rent Bank, visit: https://bcrentbank.ca/locations/To read more about the BC Rent Bank housing survey results, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2022AG0120-001248To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for people in British Columbia, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housingTo learn more about the latest action plan to deliver more homes for people faster, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Homes_For_People.pdf",

    "resolutionId": null,
    "meetingType": "Ministry of Housing",
    "contents": "VICTORIA – More affordable housing options are on the way for people in B.C. as eligibility for the upcoming Secondary Suites Incentive Program (SSIP) is being expanded to 16 regional districts.“We’re expanding the secondary suite program as part of our Homes for People action plan to support the supply of affordable long-term rentals in even more areas of the province so more people can access below-market housing in urban and rural areas alike,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “We’re using innovative solutions to make it easier for homeowners and communities to build homes faster, so people can live and work in the communities they love.”The three-year pilot SSIP was introduced in September 2023 and is set to launch in April 2024 to support the delivery of as many as 1,000 affordable rental units per year for three years. To do so, the SSIP will provide approximately 3,000 homeowners with forgivable loans for as much as $40,000 to create a new secondary suite or an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) on their property. To qualify, the units must be rented below market rates for at least five years.“Rural homeowners who want to create a rental suite and people looking for affordable homes in rural B.C. will have more options soon,” said Roly Russell, Parliamentary Secretary for Rural Development. “The housing crisis affects all corners of the province. Giving people more options and support is important, and the addition of below-market rental suites and accessory units will help rural people, and communities, everywhere.”Sixteen of B.C.’s 27 regional districts have the necessary building bylaws, and building-permit and inspection services across their electoral areas that make them eligible for the SSIP pilot. The Province will review whether it can add some of the remaining regional districts in years 2 or 3 of the SSIP, as either they do not have building bylaws and permit/inspection services or they are only provided to some areas.“The availability of affordable housing is a significant issue throughout the province in both urban and rural areas,” said Jerrilyn Kirk, director, Regional District of Fraser-Fort George and electoral area representative for the Union of BC Municipalities board. “Regional districts welcome their inclusion in the SSIP as it provides another tool to help regional districts and their residents address this challenge.”The SSIP applies to all 161 incorporated B.C. municipalities and will now also be available in the following 16 regional districts:\n\tAlberni–Clayoquot\n\tCapital\n\tCentral Kootenay\n\tCentral Okanagan\n\tCowichan Valley\n\tEast Kootenay\n\tFraser Valley\n\tFraser–Fort George\n\tKootenay Boundary\n\tNanaimo\n\tNorth Okanagan\n\tSquamish–Lillooet\n\tStrathcona\n\tSunshine Coast\n\tThompson-Nicola\n\tPeace River\n“This is a great program and it will make a difference in regional districts, too,” said Ben Maartman, director, Area H, Cowichan Valley Regional District. “I’m glad to see the government recognize this and expand eligibility to include electoral areas, and I look forward to seeing the impact this will have on housing availability in our communities for years to come.”To help homeowners navigate the process for a secondary suite, the Province released Home Suite Home, a comprehensive guide to build and manage a rental suite in British Columbia.  To help streamline the permitting process for local governments and homeowners, the Province has launched a standardized housing-design project and is developing standardized designs that will be pre-approved for ADUs and small-scale, multi-unit dwellings. Four of these standardized designs and plans for ADUs are expected to be available to local governments by summer 2024, and will help homeowners and builders save on time and costs.The SSIP project is part of the Homes for People action plan and the $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes delivered or underway.Quick Facts:\n\tLegislation was introduced on Nov. 1, 2023, to allow secondary suites and ADUs across B.C.\n\tThe Province will review whether it can add additional regional districts in years 2 or 3 of the SSIP.\n\tThe Province allocated as much as $91 million over three years for a pilot project encouraging homeowners to develop new secondary suites in 2024.\n\tThere are approximately 228,700 units that could be rented out as secondary suites in British Columbia, according to BC Assessment data from 2022.\nLearn More:For information about the Secondary Suite Incentive Program and to sign up for updates, visit: https://bchousing.org/secondary-suiteTo read the Home Suite Home guide, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/secondary-suites#suiteTo learn more about the standardized housing design, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0158-001798To read the Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436",

    "contents": "LUMBY – More seniors in Lumby will have access to affordable homes, with construction beginning on a new 20-unit housing development.“Through our Homes for People action plan, homes like these are providing seniors throughout British Columbia with the supports they need, in homes where they feel safe and connected,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “Cottonwood Place will provide another affordable option for seniors who want to live independently in the community they know.”Cottonwood Place at 1761 Glencaird St. will be a three-storey, 20-unit building for seniors who live independently. The single-bedroom units will be adaptable, with three of them wheelchair accessible. The development will include a fully accessible common space, vehicle parking and an enclosed scooter-parking room on the main floor.“Our government has built more than 700 homes in the North Okanagan since 2017 and we continue to work hard to create affordable housing for our seniors so they can age in place in the communities they love and call home,” said Harwinder Sandhu, MLA for Vernon-Monashee. “These 20 new units at Cottonwood Place in Lumby will offer all the amenities these residents need to feel safe and secure, and stay connected to their community.”This building will be the third in a campus of seniors’ housing operated by the Lumby and District Senior Citizens Housing Society. It is close to local amenities, such as the municipal hall, post office, health-care providers and the Old Age Pensioners Hall.“Developing affordable housing for seniors in our community is a top priority,” said Kevin Acton, mayor of Lumby. “To show our commitment and support, we have made an in-kind donation of more than $60,000 thus far and donated a 0.3-hectare piece of land. The project will also have a permissive tax exemption.”Recognizing extreme temperatures can have a significant impact on seniors, Cottonwood Place will be constructed with mechanical cooling and heating. This includes through-wall heat pumps in the corridors and a split-system heat pump in each residential unit to cool and heat each home. Supplementary heat will be provided in each unit through an electric backup heating coil.“We would like to thank every level of government for the support they have given to getting this project off the ground,” said Joe Deuling, president of the Lumby and District Senior Citizens Housing Society. “We look forward to working with all partners for a successful completion.”Construction of Cottonwood Place is expected to be complete in spring 2025.This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway, including more than 700 homes in the North Okanagan region.Quick Facts:\n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, is providing approximately $3.2 million through the Building BC: Community Housing Fund for the project.\n\tThe Lumby and District Senior Citizens Housing Society owns the property and will own and operate Cottonwood Place.\n\tThe Village of Lumby is contributing approximately $62,000 toward the project.\n\tThe Lumby and District Senior Citizens Housing Society is contributing land equity valued at $600,000.\nLearn More:To learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit:\nhttps://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/",

    "contents": "NANAIMO – More supports are coming for people who are unhoused and sheltering in encampments.The Province and the City of Nanaimo have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that formalizes their shared commitment to implement better homelessness response actions.“We are determined to get people experiencing homelessness the care and supports they need, so they can move from homelessness to a stable home,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “Recognizing that more needs to be done to support them, the Province and the City of Nanaimo are formalizing a commitment to work together so that encampment response is better co-ordinated and unsheltered people have appropriate supports.”The MOU clarifies the roles and responsibilities of the Province and the city in the implementation of Homeless Encampment Action Response Teams (HEART) and the Homeless Encampment Action Response Temporary Housing (HEARTH) programs. The MOU’s objectives are to prioritize the health and safety of people sheltering outdoors and to create new temporary housing options to transition people indoors. This includes the rapid development of new shelter and housing options, as well as a more co-ordinated approach to outreach and provision of support services. Through the MOU, the city has committed to bring forward available land and expedite land-use decisions for new shelter and supportive housing projects with the Province, through BC Housing.“No one is happy about the human misery in our streets. Today’s memorandum guarantees that many of our vulnerable citizens will have a safe, secure place to live with the necessary supports in place to enable them to leave street life behind them,” said Leonard Krog, mayor of Nanaimo. “The continuing challenges of our homeless population can only be solved when we actually house people and recognize their specific needs. The city is incredibly grateful for this serious commitment.”Work is underway to deliver on the commitments in the MOU. BC Housing has finalized a lease at 1300 Island Highway South for new temporary prefabricated transitional housing with supports that will provide housing for up to 50 people. In addition, 50 temporary spaces at Newcastle Place, 250 Terminal Ave., will remain open once the current residents move to Cornerstone, a new 51-unit permanent supportive housing opening at 285 Prideaux St. in the coming weeks. Island Crisis Care Society will continue operating Newcastle Place.Together, the 100 temporary spaces funded under HEARTH at 1300 Island Highway South and Newcastle Place will provide an interim housing solution for people who have been staying in shelters long-term, and free up shelter space. The Province, through BC Housing, and the city will continue to work together to identify other potential sites in the community and transition people to permanent housing, a main objective of the provincial plan to reduce and prevent homelessness.“These new homes and supports planned by B.C. and the city show how strong partnerships can deliver for people in Nanaimo,” said Sheila Malcolmson, MLA for Nanaimo. “B.C.'s opened more than 1,000 affordable homes here since 2017, with hundreds more underway, yet the need is deep and we must do more.”Nanaimo joins Prince George, Kelowna and Abbotsford, which have partnered with the Province and BC Housing to implement HEART and HEARTH programs. The Province will continue to explore opportunities with local governments to implement these programs in other communities facing significant challenges with homelessness.The HEART and HEARTH programs are part of the Province’s Belonging in BC homelessness plan. The plan will add 3,900 new supportive housing units and 240 complex-care spaces provincewide.Quote:Violet Hayes, executive director, Island Crisis Care Society –“Island Crisis Care Society believes that everyone deserves a safe and stable place to call home. We are dedicated to our vision of providing shelter and care to those in need. By providing immediate relief through the amazing team already in place at Newcastle Place (250 Terminal Ave.), we aim to create lasting change and positively impact the lives of those facing homelessness in Nanaimo.”Quick Facts:\n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, is providing a total of more than $9 million for these housing projects from the HEARTH program, and will provide annual operating funding.\n\tThe Province and the city are also partnering to implement HEART, a new multidisciplinary regional program designed to rapidly respond to encampments to better support people sheltering outdoors to move inside.\n\tThe HEART program brings together the Province and local governments, Indigenous partners, health-care agencies and non-profit organizations to quickly assess the needs of people sheltering in encampments and provide rapid access to the supports and services they need to find a home, leveraging local strengths and programs.\nLearn More:To read the MOU, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/NanaimoHEARTandHEARTH.pdfFor more information about the HEART and HEARTH program, visit: https://www.bchousing.org/housing-assistance/homelessness-services/HEART-HEARTHTo read the Belonging in BC plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/BelongingStrategy.pdf",

These homes will be open to all community members but will have a special emphasis on supporting Indigenous Peoples, including Osoyoos Indian Band members.“The Government of Canada is pleased to have supported this important development in Osoyoos,” said Harjit Sajjan, MP for Vancouver South, on behalf of Sean Fraser, federal Minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities. “We are committed to making communities stronger through projects such as these here in British Columbia and across Canada. Not only do these investments help create new jobs and stimulate the local economy, they also help to provide access to secure and affordable homes for community members. This collaborative effort is helping to ensure that more individuals have a place they can call home.”The housing project has been made possible through a partnership between the Province, through BC Housing, the Osoyoos Indian Band and the Government of Canada. Wolf Creek Housing Society, owned by the Osoyoos Indian Band, will own and operate the building which is close to schools, parks, and services.“The Osoyoos Indian Band in partnership with the B.C. government is proud to announce this housing project, which will help with the ongoing housing crises in the South Okanagan,” said Chief Clarence Louie, Osoyoos Indian Band.The building will have a mix of affordable options, including market rentals, rent geared to income and deep subsidy units. Construction is due to be completed in summer 2025.“Attainable housing in the communities we want to live in is important for all of us and these 43 new units in Osoyoos will help provide that many more individuals and families with a place to call home,” said Roly Russell, MLA for Boundary-Similkameen. “Partnerships like this help provide more affordable housing options to the community and ensure that people can continue to make a happy and healthy life in the beautiful South Okanagan.”This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway, including more than 700 homes in the Okanagan-Similkameen.Quick Facts:\n\tFunding provided for this project is as follows:\n\t\tThe Province, through BC Housing, is providing approximately $5.3 million through the Building BC: Community Housing Fund.\n\t\tA joint contribution of $1.8 million through the Canada-British Columbia Bilateral Agreement under the National Housing Strategy.\n\t\tThe Osoyoos Indian Band contributed the land equity, valued at $784,000.\n\t\n\tThe Canada-British Columbia Bilateral Agreement is part of Canada’s National Housing Strategy, an $82-billion-plus plan to give more Canadians a place to call home. Progress on programs and initiatives are updated quarterly at: https://placetocallhome.ca.\n\tThe Housing Funding Initiatives Map shows affordable housing projects that have been developed.\n\tAs of September 2023, the federal government has committed more than $38.9 billion to support the creation of more than 151,803 units and the repair of more than 241,133 units. These measures prioritize those in greatest need, including seniors, Indigenous people, people experiencing or at risk of homelessness, and women and children fleeing violence.\nLearn More:To learn about B.C.’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for people in British Columbia, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/To find the most requested Government of Canada housing information, visit: https://www.canada.ca/en/services/finance/manage/housing.htmlTo find out more about the National Housing Strategy, visit: https://placetocallhome.ca.For information about Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, visit: https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/To view the Housing Funding Initiatives Map, visit: https://www.placetocallhome.ca/housing-funding-initiatives-map",

    "resolutionId": null,
    "meetingType": "Ministry of Housing",
    "contents": "VICTORIA – The Province has issued a request for proposal (RFP) seeking a response from consultants with expertise in building design, engineering, and fire and life safety to better understand the potential for single egress stair (SES) designs in B.C. buildings. “We’re leaving no stone unturned in our work to deliver more homes faster for people,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “This work will focus on developing an understanding of if and how this innovation can be incorporated into building and fire codes in a way that maintains and enhances safety, supports access and egress, while providing more homes for people in B.C.”Current British Columbia Building Code (BCBC) and British Columbia Fire Code (BCFC) requirements call for at least two egress, or exit, stairwells per floor in many buildings three storeys and higher. The RFP seeks options for what would be needed to protect safety, access and egress of occupants, while achieving the benefits of single egress stair designs in buildings up to eight storeys – more flexibility for multi-bedroom apartments, more density within areas of transit-oriented development and the potential to improve energy efficiency in buildings.“The opportunity for new multi-family residential buildings to be designed as single stair could be a game-changer for cost savings in our projects, that could directly contribute to lowering rents,” said Steven Hurst, director of real estate development at Cool Aid Society. “It could also make development feasible on smaller lots. Small lots are often the only opportunity non-profit societies have to create new housing, but most can't accommodate a multi-family building under the current regulations without needing to acquire neighbouring properties at increased expense and longer timelines.”SES building designs can build on advancements in fire and life safety, while requiring only one exit stairwell per floor. Single egress designs promote efficiency by removing requirements for space dedicated to internal corridors and staircases, allowing for better use of space for building occupants. SES building designs are currently implemented in major cities such as Seattle and New York.  Consultants, if selected, will be required to engage with the Ministry of Housing, fire professionals, members of the accessibility community, engineers and architects, code users, technical safety specialists, and others to identify considerations and mitigation measures relating to access, egress, fire and life safety.In fall 2023, the Province adopted the British Columbia Building and Fire Codes (BC Codes 2024) to provide people with a greater level of building safety and to make new buildings more cost-effective and efficient.This work is part of the Province’s Homes for People action plan. Announced in spring 2023, the plan builds on historic action to deliver housing since 2017 and sets out further actions to deliver the homes people need faster, while creating more vibrant communities throughout B.C.The RFP will be open to consultants until Feb. 22, 2024.Quotes:Nathan Pachal, mayor, City of Langley –“This proposed change is significant in that it would make the construction of infill missing housing much easier. One of the things that Langley city council has heard from the community is the desire to have more three-bedroom units for growing families. Single egress stair designs will help deliver more affordable, small-scale three-bedroom units in our community. I’m glad to see the Province exploring the possibility.”Bryn Davidson, co-owner, Lanefab Design/Build & Oori Architecture –“Nobody loves long, dark hallways or windowless bedrooms, but that’s often the way we’re forced to build apartments in B.C. In most of the rest of the world, apartments can have more daylight, better cross breezes and more greenspace, and they don’t need to take up a whole block. What’s missing in B.C. is a small change to the building code to allow single stair buildings. I hope we can unlock this important design tool.” Uytae Lee, BC Housing board commissioner, director and producer at About Here –“I’m excited to hear that the Province is studying the potential of single-staircase buildings. The building code requirements for two exit stairwells, which were first introduced in 1941, lead to a number of constraints on ‘missing middle’ building designs, that we need now more than ever. Given all the advances we’ve made in building fire safety since then, I think it’s appropriate to assess whether that rule is still relevant now.”Learn More:To review the request for proposal, visit: https://bcbid.gov.bc.ca/page.aspx/en/bpm/process_manage_extranet/186830To learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436A map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is available at: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for people in British Columbia, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/",

The project aims to increase safety across this busy segment of Highway 1 between Beverly Street and James Street/York Road. The proposed overpass will allow people to safely cross the highway between two intersections, which are 700 metres apart.   Currently, an estimated 30% of all pedestrian movements on this section of Highway 1 are unsafe despite the existing signage restricting pedestrian access. When the new Quw’utsun Secondary School opens, the number of people crossing the highway to reach restaurants and businesses is expected to grow.The proposed new overpass will assist people travelling by foot, bicycle, wheelchair or scooter. Changes to turning lanes will help maintain the flow of traffic along the highway by reducing vehicle-turning conflicts. New curbs will increase the visibility of pedestrian pathways and crossings while helping drivers more easily identify business-access locations.The information session is scheduled for Wednesday, Feb. 7, 2024, from 4 p.m. until 7 p.m. at the Quamichan School multipurpose room (2515 Beverly St.). Ministry staff will provide an overview of the proposed design and answer questions about the project.   Learn More:Those unable to attend the information meeting will be able to view the project materials beginning on Feb. 7, 2024 online at https://gov.bc.ca/northcowichanoverpassTo find out more information about the project, email north.cowichan.overpass@gov.bc.ca",

A request for proposals is being issued on Wednesday, Jan. 24, 2024, to seek new non-profit operators for these projects, which include Hutchison Rooms (429 West Pender St.) and The Hazelwood (344 Hastings St. East) in Vancouver.BC Housing will work closely with Atira and the incoming operators to ensure there will be no interruptions for current tenants and that they will remain housed throughout the process. The operational transition of these two buildings is anticipated to be complete by June 1, 2024.This decision is the result of actions implemented in response to a March 2023 forensic investigation report of BC Housing.BC Housing is also undertaking an operational review of Atira and its subsidiaries, including Atira Women’s Resource Society, Atira Development Society and Property Management Incorporated, with a focus on governance structures and policies, and overall compliance with BC Housing policies and agreements.The B.C. government and BC Housing will continue to work with Atira to determine if other Atira-run buildings with expiring agreements should be transitioned to a new operator. If so, these will be made public as new non-profit operators are selected. The exact timelines are still being determined.BC Housing regularly reviews expiring operator agreements for properties and determines on a case-by-case basis whether to renew the existing operator or transition the property to a new operator.",

    "contents": "VICTORIA – Changes to the Residential Tenancy Regulation (RTR) will provide increased safety for staff and tenants living in supportive housing.“These changes are being made to ensure the safety of everyone living in supportive housing, staffing these sites and the community at large,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “Everyone deserves safe and stable housing. We are grateful to our partners who provide supportive housing in BC and will continue supporting them, as we continually improve the services that people rely on.”The Province is amending the RTR under the Residential Tenancy Act (RTA) to clearly define supportive housing and exempt supportive-housing units from sections of the RTA that prohibit guest policies and wellness checks. Guest policies allow operators to manage who enters the building, and wellness checks permit staff the ability to enter a tenant’s room, when needed, as a way to confirm their health, well-being and safety.“Had wellness checks been completed, my son Lindsey might not have died or been left for days undiscovered in his room,” said Christine Harris, an advocate for wellness checks, and whose son died of sepsis while living in supportive housing. “I strongly support this policy as a standard of care so our most vulnerable will not needlessly suffer, or will at least have dignity in their deaths.”Many supportive-housing providers rely on wellness checks and guest policies to ensure the safety of staff and tenants. However, these practices are not currently allowed under the RTA.In its 2018 report, the Province’s Rental Housing Task Force recommended that the specific needs of non-profit-housing and supportive-housing providers should be addressed in the RTA, such as the need to do wellness checks for their tenants, especially people with substance-use challenges.To assist supportive-housing operators, government has been working with BC Housing to develop operational standards for conducting good-faith wellness checks and to implement reasonable guest policies. Supportive-housing operators will communicate these changes to their tenants, and if tenants have any concerns they can follow the complaint resolution process, which all supportive housing providers have. These changes will come into effect on Feb. 28, 2024.The RTA establishes the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants in B.C. and governs supportive housing. Tenants living in supportive housing can continue to access the Residential Tenancy Branch dispute resolution process for issues related to sections of the RTA that continue to apply to supportive housing.In Budget 2023, government committed as much as $1.5 billion to the Belonging in BC homelessness plan, aimed at helping prevent and reduce homelessness in the province. The plan will add 3,900 new supportive-housing units and 240 complex-care spaces provincewide. Since 2017, government has delivered nearly 5,600 supportive-housing units in the province, including permanent housing for those temporarily housed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Quotes: Julian Daly, CEO, Our Place Society – “These changes are very welcome and allow us, as supportive-housing providers, to manage our buildings more effectively, help keep our residents safe and enhance the general well-being of our housing sites as well as neighbourhood security. Everyone wins with these changes.”Karen Ranalletta, president, CUPE BC –“We welcome these much-needed changes. Properly implemented wellness checks will allow our members to provide critical safety supports for residents. Supportive housing is in high demand and we want to see workers and tenants thrive whenever possible.”\n\nDel Manak, chief constable, Victoria Police Department – “Our officers routinely attend calls for situations that these changes will help minimize. We look forward to the impact these changes will have on the safety and well-being of people living in supportive housing, and to ensuring a safe working environment for the operating staff, support services, police, first responders and others involved in supportive-housing facilities.”Jill Atkey, CEO, BC Non-Profit Housing Association –“The changes announced today are a good first step in providing greater clarity for supportive-housing providers and residents and will help to ensure the well-being of people who live and work in hundreds of buildings across the province.”Keir MacDonald, CEO, Coast Mental Health –“These amendments to the RTA are an important first step in acknowledging the unique needs of supportive-housing providers that assist a range of people, including those living with mental illness and substance-use disorders. By providing these new guidelines, we have the capacity to improve the safety of both residents and front-line workers. We look forward to continuing discussions with government to clarify other areas within the RTA that would assist operators providing these services.”Dan Ruimy, mayor, Maple Ridge – “Ensuring the wellness and safety of all involved in supportive-housing environments must be the number 1 priority, which is something we can stand behind. These provincial changes are welcomed in response to valid concerns heard from operators and the community. Putting these new tools into practice will have a noticeable impact on employees as well as the residents.”Quick Facts:\n\tIn addition to these changes, the Province has made significant Residential Tenancy Branch improvements, including:\n\t\treduced wait times for dispute resolution;\n\t\treduced wait times for service by phone (less than seven minutes);\n\t\tone business day response to emails; and\n\t\tservice in more than 200 languages.\n\t\nLearn More:To read BC’s current Residential Tenancy Regulation in the RTA, visit: www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/crbc/crbc/477_2003To read about reduced wait times for Residential Tenancy Branch dispute resolutions, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0178-001974To read the Belonging in BC plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/BelongingStrategy.pdfTo learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing",

The freezing rain will continue through this evening over Langley, then change to rain. Freezing rain will continue through Friday morning over Abbotsford and Friday afternoon over Chilliwack, then turn to rain.Highways, roads and parking lots will be extremely slippery, and any travel by road should be done with caution.In the Lower Mainland, snow is expected this afternoon, which could turn to freezing rain this evening as the weather warms. The cable collar systems on the Port Mann and Alex Fraser bridges will be in operation as necessary.On Vancouver Island, Environment Canada has issued a snowfall warning for the Malahat Highway (Highway 1) from this afternoon through Friday morning. There is a risk of freezing rain over the Malahat and along eastern Vancouver Island this evening as snow changes to rain.The Province’s maintenance contractors will be out in full force applying brine and abrasives and clearing snow as it accumulates. However, freezing rain is one of the most difficult weather conditions to effectively manage, and bridges and roads may be closed to traffic in the interest of public safety.Check road conditions on DriveBC before setting out, carry an emergency kit that includes a blanket and warm clothes, and allow extra time to get to your destination.Drivers can help maintenance crews by providing space for them on highways and moving over safely when they see a vehicle with an amber light approaching. This will allow crews to improve road conditions and reduce hazards for drivers.For up-to-date information about road conditions, travelers should continue to monitor the forecast and visit: https://www.drivebc.ca/",

    "contents": "VICTORIA – The Province is supporting local governments to build more housing for people faster with funding to help them meet new provincial legislative requirements.“There is an urgent need for more homes for people, and we are working with local governments to build this housing faster,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “With new housing actions to build homes in our communities, it is important that we support local governments to improve the processes to get the housing built that people in our community desperately need. By providing them with upfront funding, instead of distributing it over time, local governments will be able to support the building of more housing as quickly as possible.”The Province recently passed a series of legislation aimed at creating more housing, such as transit-oriented development and small-scale, multi-unit housing. Starting Jan. 18, 2024, the Province will provide $51 million in grant-based funding from Budget 2023 to all municipalities, regional districts and the Islands Trust – a total of 188 local governments – in British Columbia. This funding is intended to support local governments to meet the new legislated requirements. Recognizing that local governments need immediate support to fulfil the requirements, the Province is providing this funding up front to help them undertake the necessary work. Local governments can use this funding to update housing needs reports, zoning bylaws, development cost charge and amenity cost charge bylaws, and community plans by hiring consultants and staff, and to do research and community engagement, as part of the transition to improve the development approvals process. This funding will be especially beneficial for smaller local governments that may have fewer resources to make changes.This funding is part of the historic $19-billion housing investment by government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway.Quick Facts:\n\tIn addition to the $51 million, the Province has provided a further investment of $10 million for a second intake for the Local Government Development Approvals Program (LGDAP), an application-based grant fund managed by the Union of British Columbia Municipalities that launched in 2021.\n\tLGDAP grants support local government-initiated projects to implement best practices and test innovative approaches to improve their development approval processes.\n\tApplications for this funding opened Jan. 1, 2024.

    "contents": "SURREY – Individuals, couples and families have started moving into 100 new affordable rental homes in Surrey. “Families in Surrey need access to affordable housing and that is why we continue to make historic investments in the community,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “Opening the doors on these 100 brand-new homes will change lives for the better. After decades of under investment in affordable housing in Surrey we continue to make record investments.”Located at 13583 81 Ave., Habitat @ 81st is a six-storey building with a mix of studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom homes for households with moderate and low incomes. “Habitat Housing Society and the City of Surrey are key partners in the work to bring this much-needed set of homes to Surrey, as we build more homes than ever before in B.C.,” said Rachna Singh, MLA for Surrey-Green Timbers. “Thank you to Habitat Housing Society for their work to bring 100 affordable homes, while ensuring a portion are available to people living with disabilities. I look forward to seeing the difference these homes will make in our community for years to come.”The project is a partnership between the federal and provincial governments, the City of Surrey, Metro Vancouver and the Habitat Housing Society. The building is operated by Habitat Housing Society and includes ground-level outdoor and roof-top patios, an amenity room and communal laundry on each floor. All suites include air conditioning.The building’s main floor and part of the second floor feature community services and programs delivered by Habitat's sister society, Options Community Services Society, in support of children, youth, families, immigrants and people with mental-health and addiction challenges.Rents range from $375 for a studio to $1,950 for a three-bedroom home and are a mix of rent geared to 30% of a resident‘s income, market rates and deep-subsidy rates. This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes delivered or underway, including more than 2,200 homes in Surrey. Quotes:Sukh Dhaliwal, MP for Surrey-Newton –“This new rental development here in Surrey is a great example of our government taking action to increase supply and strengthen this growing community. Through the Affordable Housing Fund, we are not only housing more Canadians, but we are providing them with access to the support and services they need right where they live. I am so proud to see the work of our National Housing Strategy coming to life through projects such as this.” John Aldag, MP for Cloverdale-Langley City –“Our government is investing in affordable housing here in Surrey and across Canada to help create jobs and improve the quality of life for those who need it most. Thanks to the combined efforts of our partners, we are able to give a helping hand to individuals in need, and in doing so, we are contributing to the economic and social well-being of the entire community.” Randeep Sarai, MP for Surrey Centre –“The Government of Canada is helping to make affordable housing available in British Columbia and across the country for those who need it most. Projects like this one in Surrey demonstrate how all levels of government are collaborating with organizations to implement solutions to local housing challenges that will improve the overall well-being of residents.”Brenda Locke, mayor of Surrey –\"Creating homes to address the housing crisis is a priority and I’m thrilled to see 100 new purpose-built rental homes being added to Surrey's housing stock that will help residents thrive by creating safe, stable and affordable housing. The City recognizes its role in expediting projects and that’s why we were happy to waive development fees for Habitat @ 81st. I thank the Province, CMHC and Habitat Housing Society for their significant investments.\"Christine Mohr, CEO, Options Community Services Society –“Habitat Housing Society and its sister society, Options Community Services, are thrilled to be delivering 100 critically needed new homes to people in our community. We gratefully acknowledge the support of the Government of Canada, the Government of British Columbia, and many community supporters for making this building possible. It is through our shared commitment to building community that we inspire hope and, quite literally, open doors.”George V. Harvie, chair of Metro Vancouver’s board of directors –“Metro Vancouver recognizes the critical need for affordable housing and is pleased to have supported this outstanding project by waiving $353,000 in development cost charges. We encourage the construction of new affordable units across the region with our development cost charge waiver program, currently geared toward non-profits and student housing. Metro Vancouver is actively looking to expand the waiver program to better incentivize the construction of rental housing in the region.”Quick Facts: \n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, contributed $21.2 million for the project, including:\n\t\t$15.4 million from the Affordable Rental Housing Program; and\n\t\t$5.8 million from the Building BC: Community Housing Fund.\n\t\n\tThe CMHC contributed $5.9 million through the federal Affordable Housing Fund, previously the National Housing Co-Investment Fund.  \n\tHabitat Housing Society provided the land, valued at approximately $2.5 million, and equity of $5.5 million. \n\tThe City of Surrey waived $269,094 in development fees, and Metro Vancouver waived $353,000 in development fees.\nLearn More: To learn about B.C.’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housingFor information about Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, visit: https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.caTo find out about the National Housing Strategy, visit: http://www.placetocallhome.ca",

Bridges and roads may be closed to traffic in the interest of public safety.In the Lower Mainland, the cable collar systems on the Port Mann and Alex Fraser bridges will be in operation as necessary. On Vancouver Island, the Highway 1/Malahat Chain Up Protocol will be implemented at 2 p.m. on Tuesday and will remain overnight as needed.With the risk of freezing rain, people should avoid travel by vehicle on Tuesday night through Wednesday morning’s commute. Should travel be necessary, drivers must ensure their vehicle is properly equipped for winter conditions, including having winter or snow-rated tires in good condition.Please check road conditions on DriveBC before setting out, carry an emergency kit that includes a blanket and warm clothes, and allow extra time to get to your destination.Drivers can help maintenance crews by providing space for them on highways and moving over safely when they see a vehicle with an amber light approaching. This will allow crews to improve road conditions and reduce hazards for drivers.For up-to-date information about road conditions, travellers should continue to monitor the forecast and visit: https://www.drivebc.ca/",

The question on the motion was not called as in response to queries from Council, staff advised (i) the vast majority of the outreach worker job responsibilities will entail being out in the field providing outreach, and working non standard hours, and (ii) a memorandum is forthcoming with more information on the outreach worker position. The question on the referral motion was then called and CARRIED. As a result of the discussion the following referral motion was introduced: R24/1-16 It was moved and seconded That staff review and report back on what is needed in the form of in kind services, people and funding to support the fifteen non-profit organizations providing emergency meals to feed food insecure individuals in Richmond and the feasibility of providing this support. CARRIEDBelinda Boyd and Hugh Frieberg, Richmond Food Aid Delivery Coalition, expressed their support of the motion regarding Homeless Crisis from the October 16, 2023 General Purposes Committee and spoke about the critical need for after hours outreach staff. Referring to their letter to Council (Copy on file) they highlighted that (i) outreach professionals are essential in ensuring that homeless individuals have access to a nightly meal and for connecting them to crucial housing, mental, addiction, emergency dental, and other essential health services, (ii) the new city outreach positions should work with the community based outreach workers to establish coordination and collaboration, (iii) faith communities are providing meals for the homeless outreach but additional funding is needed to support staffing, reduce burnout and secure sufficient food supplies, and (iv) there is a need for a city-funded homeless outreach program with afterhours as well as regular outreach staff. In response to a query from Council the delegation noted that the benefit of contracting out the outreach staff positions is that it may be more cost effective then having an in house city position and there are many agencies and organizations that have experience in outreach work that may be able to fill these positions quicker. As a result of the discussion the following referral motion was introduced:",

Compared with 2022, the number of registered rental units increased by 30.9%.“Our government’s actions to tackle the housing crisis are starting to take hold as evidenced in the record-setting number of purpose-built homes registered in B.C. last year,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “When you compare that to the fewer than 2,000 rental units registered in 2012, it’s quite remarkable how the landscape has changed under our government. I’d like to thank our province’s construction industry for its work to get more homes built for the people of B.C.”In total, 45,647 new homes were registered in B.C. in 2023. These include 6,522 single detached homes and 39,125 multi-unit homes.Registered new-home data is collected at the beginning of a project, before building permits are issued, making it a leading indicator of housing activity in B.C.Quick Facts:\n\tUnder the Homeowner Protection Act, all new homes in the province are required to be registered with BC Housing before a building permit is issued.\n\tEach new home must either be enrolled in home-warranty insurance by a licensed residential builder or have an applicable exemption, such as a purpose-built rental exemption or an owner-builder exemption.\n\tHome-warranty insurance protects new homes in B.C. against construction defects in materials and labour, building envelope and structural defects.\n\tThe Province is supporting the creation of new housing in B.C. by making a $19-billion housing investment through its Homes for People plan, which is the largest housing investment in B.C.’s history.\n\tThrough the Province’s investments since 2017, more than 77,000 homes have been delivered or are underway.\nLearn More:To read the December 2023 New Homes Registry Report, visit:\nhttps://www.bchousing.org/research-centre/housing-data/new-homes-dataTo learn about home-warranty insurance on new homes, visit:\nhttps://www.bchousing.org/licensing-consumer-services/new-homesTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit:\nhttps://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing",

    "contents": "Resolution: It was moved and seconded That the staff report titled, “Financial Information – 3rd Quarter September 30, 2023”, dated December 1, 2023 from the Director, Finance, be received for information.Discussion ensued with respect to gaming revenue allocation (“revenue allocation”) and the RCMP vacancy rate. Staff noted (i) during the 2024 budget process, revenue allocation remained the funding mechanism for four police officers (as originally introduced a number of years ago), but not necessarily tied to the activities of the RCMP, (ii) anticipated changes to the revenue allocation can be done through the 2025 budget process, (iii) a reduction in the revenue allocation for officer activity would mean any difference required to fund officer activity would be a tax draw, (iv) the vacancy rate for the Richmond Detachment is relatively low at a range of 6% to 8% per year, (v) although available funding is indicated, the allocation of new officers from RCMP Depot can take 12 to 18 months, in which case those available funds are allocated, and (vi) any surplus in the community safety budget is directed to general surplus, some of which will be used to bring down the following year’s taxes. Further discussion ensued with respect to security presence at the River Rock Casino (“Casino”). Staff noted that although the RCMP does not have four members permanently at the Casino, general duty officers patrol the area daily and at any point there could be more or less officers on site. Staff further noted the RCMP does not provide regular security for the Casino, the Casino has their own security people they pay to patrol the floor. In response to queries from the Committee, staff noted (i) Richmond hotel room revenue is surpassing pre-pandemic levels, (ii) the majority of the budget (approximately 60%) relates to salaries, and (iii) favourable variances in vacancies, including anticipated turnover, is somewhat consistent quarter over quarter. Discussion ensued with respect to new and closed businesses and vacancies in office/industrial space. Staff noted (i) there is no specific data on how many business have closed but it appears to be consistent year to year in terms of the number of valid businesses, whereas the number of new business licenses has increased (number of net new businesses to be provided for next report), and (ii) industrial vacancy space has increased slightly but still well below a healthy market and office vacancy space has edged up to 9.9% but still below in terms of other markets.",

    "resolutionId": null,
    "meetingType": "Ministry of Housing",
    "contents": "PORT ALBERNI – Seniors and people living with disabilities in Port Alberni now have access to more affordable rental housing with the opening of Huupsitas, a new 48-unit apartment building.“The Huupsitas building will provide the kind of stability and security that seniors and people living with disabilities need more of, so they can retire in the community they know and love,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “Our government is building housing at a historic rate, and these 48 new homes are another example of how we’re building a province where everyone has a good place to call home and no one gets left behind.”Located at 6161 Russell Pl., the five-storey building has 45 one-bedroom units and three two-bedroom apartments. The WestCoast Native Health Care Society contributed the land for the building, which forms part of the five-acre Tsawaayuus Rainbow Gardens Campus of Care. The site is home to a 44-unit complex care facility and a 20-unit independent living apartment building.“Accessible housing like this is part of our commitment to ensure people can continue to live affordably, and close to family, community and culture,” said Josie Osborne, MLA for Mid Island-Pacific. “Our government shares the community’s excitement in seeing these homes opened, and we will continue to work with our partners to support housing needs for seniors and people living with disabilities.”Huupsitas provides independent seniors with the ability to age in place. Half the units have their rent geared to income where rent is 30% of the tenant’s income. Nine units will be rented to households with very low incomes, such as those receiving income or disability assistance or a basic senior’s pension. The remaining units will be rented at the low end of market rents, between $750 for a one-bedroom and $850 for a two-bedroom. Ten of the units are fully wheelchair accessible, while the remaining units can be easily adapted if a tenant’s accessibility needs change in the future. The building is open to both Indigenous and non-Indigenous residents.This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes delivered or underway, including nearly 480 homes in Port Alberni.Quotes:Margaret Pfoh, CEO, Aboriginal Housing Management Association –“Enabling this housing is a much-needed act of reconciliACTION. This development provides equitable access to safe, affordable, culturally supported living for Indigenous elders. A place to call home is essential for the well-being of all Indigenous youth, families, elders and peoples.”Derek Appleton, chair, WestCoast Native Health Care Society –“We are very pleased with the support from the provincial government to add to our campus of care. Residents in the existing affordable living apartments have had a life-changing experience moving into the new building where a community of tenants has formed. A home and a wholesome connection to other human beings is conducive to well-being for everyone.”Sharie Minions, mayor, City of Port Alberni –“The opening of Huupsitas will ensure our seniors have access to affordable, stable housing and are able to age in place in a community they love. My gratitude goes out to the WestCoast Native Health Care Society who continue to do great work advocating for independent seniors and Indigenous elders in our community.”Quick Facts:\n\tHuupsitas translates to “side of a hill” in Nuu-chah-nulth.\n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, provided approximately $5 million to the project through the Building BC: Community Housing Fund and will provide about $300,000 in annual operating funding.\n\tThe Community Housing Fund is a 10-year, $3.3-billion investment to build more than 20,000 affordable rental homes for people with low or moderate incomes.\nLearn More:To learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/",

    "contents": "DUNCAN – More than 30 people experiencing homelessness in Duncan will continue to have access to safe homes with supports as the Province, through BC Housing, has extended operating funding for The Village until 2027.  “The Village has been a tremendous success in Duncan, and we are proud to help ensure its residents can continue to stay in their homes, while we work to open more permanent housing in the community,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “Homelessness is not a problem that can be easily solved, which is why we will continue to explore unique and innovative initiatives like The Village to support B.C.’s most vulnerable people.”The Village is a temporary supportive housing site with 34 individual sleeping units at 610 Trunk Rd. in Duncan. The housing is operated by Lookout Housing and Health Society, which provides residents with daily meals, and health and wellness supports. The Village opened at a different site as a pilot project by the Cowichan Housing Association to provide immediate housing for vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic. It moved to the Trunk Road property in 2022.“The Village opened in July 2020 and continues to improve as we learn and adapt,” said Michelle Staples, mayor of Duncan. “What began as a pandemic response has grown into a culturally safe wellness and recovery model. This site fills an essential gap in the continuum of housing and the city is pleased to receive continued support from the Province.”The extension is being funded through the Province’s newly established Homelessness Encampment Action Response Temporary Housing (HEARTH) program. HEARTH provides emergency housing, shelter options and immediate co-ordinated supports to help people in encampments or sheltering in public spaces to move indoors and access temporary or permanent housing options that fit their needs.Residents at The Village will eventually move to permanent supportive housing under construction in the community. The project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway, including more than 350 homes in Duncan.Quotes:Doug Routley, MLA for Nanaimo-North Cowichan –“The Village has brought vulnerable people safely indoors and connected them with services so they have supports they need to begin to rebuild their lives. Our work doesn’t stop here. I look forward to continuing to work with the Cowichan community on permanent housing solutions for people in our community.”Shayne Williams, CEO, Lookout Housing and Health Society –“Lookout Housing and Health Society is proud to operate The Village, which provides safe and healthy housing for some of our communities most vulnerable in Duncan. Lookout is honoured to partner with BC Housing and the City of Duncan on this successful housing model that demonstrates better health outcomes for those who call The Village their home.”Rob Douglas, mayor, North Cowichan –“Funding for the continued operation of The Village will not only benefit Duncan, but also North Cowichan and the broader Cowichan region. Through temporary housing and extensive supports, this model has proven successful in helping people facing homelessness to get back on their feet, improve their health and well-being, and access services.”Quick Facts:\n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, will provide approximately $1.5 million in annual operating funding for the Village through Dec. 31, 2026.\n\tThe HEARTH program is part of Belonging in BC, the Province's plan to prevent and reduce homelessness.\n\tThe plan will also add thousands of new supportive housing units and hundreds of complex-care spaces provincewide.\n\tBC Housing provided the land for the project, which will be used in the future for an affordable housing development.\n\tThe housing structures are owned by Cowichan Housing Association.\nLearn More:To learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436A map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is available online: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/",

    "contents": "VICTORIA – Contractors who build and maintain British Columbia’s vital roads and transportation infrastructure have been honoured for their work helping to keep people and goods on the move.The B.C. Transportation Contractor of the Year awards celebrate achievements in construction, road and bridge maintenance, safety and community service.“These companies have gone above and beyond to provide excellent service to British Columbians, often during some challenging circumstances like extreme weather and wildfires,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “They have shown extraordinary commitment to innovation, diversity, community service and the environment.”Bridges and Structures award:Gitga’at Park Derochie Industrial Services Inc. is being recognized with the Bridges and Structures award for their rehabilitation of the Old Skeena Bridge near Terrace – bridging the past, present and future. The company’s work preserved the 1925 bridge’s historical significance, a symbol of the region’s rich heritage and scenic beauty. Facing a significant increase in the project's scope, the firm added a second shift and finished the work four months before schedule. Gitga’at Park Derochie also protected the surrounding natural habitat to ensure that the bridge remained a vital link in an environmentally sensitive fish-bearing river used by First Nations people for traditional activities.Paving award:Dawson Construction Limited is receiving the Paving award for resurfacing more than 54 kilometres of Highway 97 at Hixon, south of Prince George. The company’s use of 15% recycled-asphalt pavement created a smoother and sustainable road. The company switched gears and helped manage traffic during the fire season. The community appreciated Dawson’s frequent communication with the Township of Hixon. The company completed the project well ahead of schedule and within budget.Grading award:Thompson Brothers Construction is receiving the Grading award for rising to challenging circumstances in completing the Highway 29 Lynx Creek bridge replacement and highway-realignment project. As a response to flooding from a reservoir, the project included a large highway-embankment fill, a 150-metre bridge and a 280-metre causeway crossing Lynx Creek. The company moved more than two million cubic metres of material. Thompson Brothers extended a stability berm, provided embankment-wave protection and adapted final grading while adjusting schedules to accommodate new work and delays due to wildfire evacuations. While work was underway, the company maintained community access to a boat launch. Workplace Health and Safety award:AIM Roads is receiving the Workplace Health and Safety award for using a system to enhance worker safety during road maintenance, with far-reaching significance that could lead to fewer accidents or injuries across the road-construction industry. The Safety Intelligent Protection Technology (SIPT) system protects road-maintenance crews by creating a virtual fence and AI-driven hazard alarms, in addition to traffic-control devices. SIPT’s alerts mean that workers now react more swiftly to potential hazards. AIM has had fewer incidents and worker injuries since it began using SIPT.  Road and Bridge Maintenance award:Capilano Highway Services is receiving the Road and Bridge Maintenance award for redefining industry standards to keep people and goods on the move on the Sunshine Coast, with innovations like safety and quality software programs, smartphone apps and improvements to winter maintenance. The company excels in emergency operations, stepping up for temporary storm repairs to ensure safety for road users. The company supports a range of community activities and is committed to diversity and inclusivity, including hiring First Nations subcontractors. Community Service award:Yellowhead Road & Bridge Ltd. (Vanderhoof) is receiving the Community Service award. For five years, the company has partnered with the non-profit Murray Ridge Ski Area, providing crucial road maintenance, snow removal and parking-lot care to ensure safe travel for students on ski days. This partnership saves the ski club thousands of dollars each season and makes skiing more affordable for people in the community. The company also partnered with the Stellat’en First Nation on the Stella Road pedestrian walkway project, donating materials, equipment and more than 550 person hours. This one-kilometre route separates pedestrians from traffic and enjoys widespread community use, including families with children, elders, and people who use wheelchairs. Learn More:For pictures, videos and more information about the finalists and winners, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=1D2156A81E88455591A34B7AB9024A56",

    "contents": "SURREY – The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure is taking steps to keep people and goods moving safely and efficiently when winter weather hits the Lower Mainland.On Lower Mainland highways, the Province’s road and bridge maintenance contractors are prepped and ready. Weather conditions are closely monitored and anti-icing brine is proactively applied when freezing temperatures are forecast. The ministry has also worked with its contractors to improve how plows and tow trucks are deployed during snowy conditions.With any winter-weather event, bridge conditions can be unpredictable and can change quickly. Conditions on bridge structures, especially over water, behave differently than a regular highway. The Port Mann and Alex Fraser bridges are equipped with a cable-collar system to remove ice and snow from the cables. Advanced weather data means crews are better prepared and can activate the systems sooner to remove snow in bad weather as quickly as possible.In certain conditions, a partial or full closure of the bridges and roads may be necessary to ensure driver safety. The ministry will update people as quickly as possible about any closure through DriveBC and its social media channels, and other methods such as signage and traffic advisories to local media.As each weather event can be unique, the ministry and its maintenance contractors will also continue to work closely with local governments on assessing, preparing and communicating for each event as it occurs.During snowy weather, drivers are encouraged to plan and check DriveBC, stay off the road if conditions worsen, and to ensure their vehicle is properly equipped with snow tires if they have to travel.Drivers can also assist maintenance crews by moving over safely when they see a vehicle with an amber light approaching. This allows maintenance crews to clear the snow and improve road conditions, to reduce hazards for drivers and help them get to where they’re going safely.Learn More:For resources on how to stay safe on the road in winter, visit: https://roadsafetyatwork.ca/campaign/shift-into-winter/To check road conditions, visit: https://www.drivebc.ca/",

    "contents": "VICTORIA – Regulations and policy manuals have been issued to further support local governments as they work in partnership with homebuilders to deliver more homes for people.“Over the fall session, our government passed comprehensive laws to deliver more homes for people faster in every part of B.C.,” said Premier David Eby. “We are in a housing crisis and we will continue to take strong action to deliver thousands more middle-class homes families can afford.”In the fall legislative session, the government introduced a suite of housing legislation to deliver more homes for people faster in every part of B.C.Today, details and technical resources to support the implementation of Bill 35 – Short-Term Rental Accommodations Act, Bill 44 – Housing Statutes (Residential Development) Amendment Act and Bill 47 – Housing Statutes (Transit-Oriented Areas) Amendment Act have been provided to local governments.“The action we are taking is strong, comprehensive and designed to meet one of the greatest challenges people face, here in B.C., and in jurisdictions across Canada and around the world,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “We leveraged ideas from some of the most successful action taken on housing from around the world and we made B.C. a leader. These regulations will help local governments work with homebuilders to deliver viable housing projects, that help more people find homes in existing neighbourhoods and next to transit hubs.”Bill 35 – Short-Term Rental Accommodations Act:Like many jurisdictions around the world, B.C. is regulating short-term rentals to turn more units into long-term homes for people. The new rules give local governments stronger enforcement tools, restrict short-term rentals to principal residences and either a secondary suite or an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) in many B.C. communities, and establish a new provincial role in regulating short-term rentals.Regulations define what constitutes a principal residence, list the communities where the principal-residency requirement applies and detail accommodation-service providers that will be exempt from the principal-residence requirement, such as some strata-titled hotels and motels, fishing/hunting lodges and time shares.The guidelines also provide additional details, including how local governments can annually request by resolution to the Province to “opt out” of the principal-residence requirement if the community has a rental-vacancy rate of 3% or more for two consecutive years, and assist local governments applying the new provincial legislation alongside existing local government short-term rental bylaws.Bill 44 – Housing Statutes (Residential Development) Amendment Act:Historical zoning rules in many B.C. communities have resulted in new housing being mostly in the form of condos or single-family homes that are out of reach for many people, leaving a shortage of options for the types of housing in between. Zoning barriers and layers of regulations have also slowed down the delivery of housing, making people go through long, complicated processes to build much-needed housing in communities.The regulations detail requirements for local governments to update zoning bylaws to allow either a minimum of one secondary suite or detached accessory dwelling unit, a minimum of three to four dwelling units, or a minimum of six dwelling units in selected areas near bus stops with frequent transit service.  The Small-Scale Multi-Unit Housing Provincial Policy Manual with site standards has also been released to help local governments work with homebuilders to move forward with viable housing projects. Municipalities are required by legislation to consider this manual when developing local zoning bylaws and policies.   Bill 47 – Housing Statutes (Transit-Oriented Areas) Amendment Act:In some cases, higher-density neighbourhoods have been established around transit hubs, but in other cases, restrictive zoning bylaws and parking requirements, along with delayed development approvals, continue to slow down the delivery of homes and services near transit hubs.Through regulations, transit-oriented development (TOD) areas have now been defined. The regulations will prescribe 104 TOD Areas in 31 municipalities throughout B.C. within the first year of the legislation coming into effect. A full list of these municipalities is available in Backgrounder 2.The Provincial Policy Guidance Manual: Transit-Oriented Areas is a resource created to support local governments with the implementation of provincial Transit Oriented Area (TOA) requirements. The manual defines transit-oriented areas, prescribes minimum allowable densities and restricts local governments’ ability to mandate residential parking. Municipalities are required by legislation to consider this manual when developing bylaws for TOAs. Further details of regulations for all three pieces of legislation, including links to policy manuals and regulations, are included in the backgrounder at the end of this release.Modelling scenarios:In addition, the Province has released detailed modelling scenarios for the implementation of Bill 44 and 47. The Ministry of Housing retained a group of leading economic and planning experts to analyze what impacts the new frameworks for more small-scale, multi-unit homes (SSMUH) and designated transit-oriented development areas could have in B.C.The analysis used relevant international examples of recent zoning changes, particularly in New Zealand and Washington state, and examples from B.C., such as Kelowna. It’s important to note that modelling of future scenarios cannot account for unforeseen circumstances, the changing nature of housing, real estate markets and other factors.The findings from the analysis anticipates small-scale, multi-unit and transit-oriented development legislation could lead to between 216,000 and 293,000 additional net-new housing units for British Columbians over the next 10 years.The full report is now available to be accessed in Backgrounder 1.The legislation and the accompanying regulations and guides are part of the Province’s Homes for People action plan. Announced in spring 2023, the plan builds on historic action to deliver housing since 2017 and sets out further actions to deliver the homes people need faster, while creating more vibrant communities throughout B.C.Timelines:\n\tReleased today:\n\t\tregulations for Bill 35, 44, 47 deposited;\n\t\tProvince designates interim TOD Areas and policy manual released; and\n\t\tsmall-scale, multi-unit housing policy manual provided to local governments.\n\t\n\n\tJanuary 2024:\n\t\t$51 million distributed to local governments to help meet new requirements that promote the Province’s housing-density initiatives.  \n\t\n\n\tEarly 2024:\n\t\tHousing Needs Report guidance provided to local governments.\n\t\n\n\tFeb. 29, 2024:\n\t\tlocal governments’ request must be submitted to opt out of the principal-residence requirement.\n\t\n\n\tMay 1, 2024:\n\t\tprincipal-residence requirement (including definition of exempt areas or accommodations), changes to legal non-conforming use protections; and\n\t\tshort-term rental hosts will be required to display a valid business licence number on their listing, where a business licence is required by a local government.\n\t\n\n\tJune/July 2024:\n\t\tguidance provided to municipalities to update Official Community Plans and zoning bylaws.\n\t\t \n\t\n\tJune 30, 2024:\n\t\tlocal governments must have designated TOD Areas bylaw and removed minimum residential-parking requirements; and\n\t\tlocal governments must have updated their zoning bylaw to accommodate small-scale, multi-unit housing requirements (except in areas where they have applied for an extension).\n\t\n\n\tJan. 1, 2025:\n\t\tlocal governments must have completed their interim Housing Needs Report.\n\t\n\n\tDec. 31, 2025:\n\t\tmunicipalities update of their Official Community Plans and zoning bylaws (based on the interim Housing Needs Report).\n\t\nQuotes: Jens von Bergmann, Mountain Math –  “The SSMUH and TOA policies enable more housing options across the province, especially in centrally located areas with good transit access. We estimate that these initiatives will produce around 250,000 net-new homes over the next 10 years, helping British Columbians to form households more freely and live in communities of their choice, reducing rents and prices significantly below what they would have been in the absence of these reforms. The legislation serves to boost supply elasticity and help bring the price of housing back in line with the cost to build it.”Jake Fry, founder and principal, Smallworks – “The new standards create a pathway to ground-oriented, family-sized homes, complete with access to green space. This is the type of bold leadership we need to enable truly attainable housing for British Columbians.”Mike P. Moffatt, PLACE Centre Smart Prosperity Institute –“British Columbia’s reforms to allow for more homes near transit provides a model for other provinces to emulate. It will allow families to live closer to where they work, play and shop, and significantly reduce emissions from transportation. Hundreds of thousands of homes will now exist, thanks to this suite of policies.”Leo Spalteholz, advocate, Homes for Living – “Of the suite of reforms passed this fall, removing barriers to transit-oriented development has the potential to deliver the most new housing in the shortest timeframe in B.C.  In a time of rising construction costs, de-risking approvals and reducing costs for housing is crucial to address the shortage of homes.”Peter Waldkirch, director, Abundant Housing Vancouver –  “For too long, renters and people living in apartments have been confined to a minority of Vancouver's land. Even in the face of a severe housing shortage, apartments are banned close to some Skytrain stations. Abundant Housing Vancouver welcomes these steps towards legalizing housing near transit, along with others that will open up more areas to increased housing choice and new neighbours.”Julius Bloomfield, mayor of Penticton –“The housing crisis requires all levels of government to focus on creating more housing stock across the entire spectrum and the introduction of the regulations for short-term rentals brings clarity. Developers can either build vacation-accommodation only units that meet the regulations or they can construct long-term housing projects. Penticton continues to experience rapid growth and needs partners to help meet the economic, social and housing challenges ahead.”Jack Crompton, mayor, Resort Municipality of Whistler –“Housing for tourism workers really is the most important strategic priority for ensuring a strong and growing tourism economy for B.C. The enforcement tools the Province has made available through this legislation will allow Whistler to be more effective in our regulation of short-term rentals. This is good legislation.”Thorben Wieditz, executive director, Fairbnb Canada Network –“Fairbnb Canada Network would like to thank Housing Minister Kahlon for his leadership in establishing provincewide short-term rental regulations in B.C. The new regulatory measures will go a long way in helping local governments more effectively enforce short-term rental regulations and return much-needed housing stock to the long-term rental market. Establishing a provincial short-term rental registry, a provincewide principal residence requirement, platform accountability and data-sharing measures establish B.C. as a nationwide leader in protecting scarce housing stock from conversion into ghost-hotel inventory. We hope that more provinces will learn from B.C. and follow suit.”Learn More:To view a set of summary slides about the regulations and policy manuals, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/HousingGuidelines_Regs_SummarySlides_V2.pdf  To learn about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To view a map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C., visit: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/For more information about B.C. legislation, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/legislationFour backgrounders follow.Resources for Bill 35 – Short-Term Rental Accommodation Act:\nTo read the guidelines, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STRPolicyGuidance2023.pdfResources for Bill 44 - Housing Statutes (Residential Development) Amendment Act and Bill 47- Housing Statutes (Transit-Oriented Development) Amendment Act: \nTo read the SSMUH and TOD Area policy manuals, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/local-governments-and-housing/housing-initiativesOther resources:\nTo read the full report on SSMUH and TOA scenarios in B.C., visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/bc_SSMUH_TOA_scenarios_Final.pdfTo view the regulations for all three Bills, visit: https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/The Short-Term Rental Accommodation Act establishes a provincial role in the regulation of short-term rentals.The legislation defines short-term rentals as rental listings that are being offered for stays of less than 90 consecutive days, and establishes a provincial principal-residence requirement in most communities.The legislation applies to all short-term rentals being offered to the public, including:\n\toffers hosted by a platform, where people reserve and pay for the rental service, like Airbnb, Expedia [VBRO and Homeaway] and Flipkey;\n\toffers on other web listing forums or sites established by property managers such as Facebook Marketplace, Kijiji or Craigslist; and\n\toffers in classified ads in newspapers.\nThe principal-residence requirement will apply in communities with a population more than 10,000, as well as some smaller neighbouring communities. A full list of communities where the primary-residence requirement will apply is available at: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/short-term-rentalsEffective May 1, 2024, in areas where the principal-residence requirement applies, short-term rentals will be limited to a host’s principal residence, and either a secondary suite or accessory dwelling unit (ADU) for most types of accommodation. Even if exempt from the principal-residence requirement, short-term rentals will be subject to provincial rules, including registration with the provincial registry, once the registry is in effect.Accommodation exemptions:The legislation does not apply to:\n\thotels, motels;\n\tvehicles such as recreational vehicles (RVs); and\n\ttents or temporary shelters.\nLand exempt from principal-residency requirement:\n\tStrata-titled hotel or motel if the owner may not use the property as a principal residence.\n\tProperties where owners hold a fractional interest and cannot use the property as their principal residence due to provisions in a fractional ownership agreement.\n\tTime Share properties.\n\tHome exchanges.\n\tLodges (accommodation provided by an operator of outdoor recreational activities such as hunting, fishing, water sports).\n\tStudent accommodation (owned or operated by the educational institution or by a non-profit organization).\n\tStrata-corporation guest suites intended for people visiting strata residents.\n\tRegional-district electoral areas (except University of British Columbia and the University Endowment Lands), with a choice to request to opt in by board resolution.\n\tMunicipalities with populations less than 10,000 and are not within 15 kilometres of a larger municipality (as specified in the regulation), with a choice to request to opt in by council resolution.\n\tFourteen resort municipalities, with the choice to request to opt in.\n\tForty-four mountain resorts/ski areas, comprising regional/destination resorts, BC Parks resorts, some private resorts and community ski resorts, with no provisions for opting in.*\n\tThe trust area (as defined in section 1 of the Island Trust Act), with a choice for local trust committees to request to opt in.*\n\tLand with BC Assessment farm class (Class 9), whether in the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) or not*.\n*Note: Lands described in the final three bullets would remain exempt if the municipality or regional district surrounding them requested to opt in.Opting out of the principal-residence requirement:Municipalities with a population more than 10,000 in 2021 Census and a rental-vacancy rate of 3% or more for each of the two previous years can opt out of the principal-residence requirement. Municipalities with populations less than 10,000 in 2021, but that are within 15 kilometres of a municipality more than 10,000 that has a rental-vacancy rate that is 3% or more for each of the previous two years, can also opt out.Data for vacancy rates can be obtained through the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) report, which is published in late January of each year.For 2024, a local government’s request must be submitted to the Province by Feb. 29, 2024, to opt out of the principal-residence requirement before it comes into effect on May 1, 2024. In future, a local government’s request must be submitted to the Province by March 31st of each year, and the change will take effect on Nov. 1 of the same year.Opting into the principal-residence requirement:Municipalities with under 10,000 population, regional-district electoral areas and resort municipalities will be exempt from the principal-residence requirement, but may request to opt in. Mountain/ski resorts in rural areas are also exempt with no opt-in provision.Local governments requesting to opt in must submit written requests accompanied by resolutions. Requests should include appropriate background information that describes the area and jurisdiction. The request must be submitted to the minister of housing by March 31st of each year (starting in 2024) to take effect on Nov. 1 of the same year (starting in 2024) to give hosts notice to comply. Opting in remains in effect indefinitely unless a subsequent request to reverse the exemption is made by March 31st of a future year.Business licensing:As of May 1, 2024, short-term rental hosts will be required to display a valid business licence number on their listing, where a business licence is required by a local government. To enable local governments to validate the business licence number (if they wish to do so), platforms will be required to enable the posting of the business licence number.For short-term rentals, business licensing can provide valuable information about where these rentals are operating in the community.Regional districts now have broad business and licensing powers, parallel to those of municipalities, in accordance with Division 6.1 of the Local Government Act.Sharing data:Short-term rental platforms must record and maintain any short-term rental information provided to them and disclose that information to the minister of housing. This information may be shared with local governments. More information will be released in spring 2024.Fines and penalties:The new legislation increased the maximum penalties available to regional districts. The maximum penalty that a regional district may specify for bylaw offences prosecuted under the Offence Act has been increased to $50,000.The maximum fine that a local government and local trust committee of the Islands Trust may set for a bylaw ticket has been increased from $1,000 to $3,000 per infraction per day in accordance with the Community Charter Bylaw Enforcement Ticket Regulation and Vancouver Charter By-Law Enforcement Ticket Regulations.The Province is also introducing a short-term rental compliance and enforcement unit to support the implementation of the new legislation. The unit will act as a conduit between the platforms and local governments for data-sharing, facilitate the process for the removal of short-term rental listings that do not have valid local government business licences from platforms, and undertake enforcement actions related to the provincial short-term rentals regulatory regime.The policy manual is to be used by all local governments in B.C. to guide updates to zoning bylaws, other regulatory bylaws and policies undertaken to comply with small-scale multi-unit housing legislation. Subsequent resources or information bulletins may be issued by the Province to clarify or elaborate on changes to the requirements.Small-Scale Multi-Unit Housing (SSMUH) refers to a range of buildings and dwelling-unit configurations that can provide more affordable and attainable housing for middle-income families. Examples of SSMUH include, but are not limited to:\n\tsecondary suites in single-family dwellings or duplexes;\n\tdetached accessory-dwelling units (ADUs) like garden suites or laneway homes;\n\tduplexes (side-by-side or up/down);\n\ttriplexes and house-plexes; and\n\ttown homes.\nThe SSMUH legislation identifies where the prescribed number of housing units must be permitted by local governments on single-family and duplex lots with certain characteristics. Whether the prescribed number of housing units must be permitted on a given lot is determined by a variety of factors, including:\n\twhether or not the lot is within an urban containment boundary established by a regional growth strategy or an official community plan;\n\tlot size;\n\twhether a lot is serviced by municipal water and sewerage systems; and\n\tfor municipalities: population size, proximity of a given lot to transit services and the presence of specific heritage designations.\nLocal governments must amend their zoning and any related bylaws by June 30, 2024, to comply with this legislation and must consider the policy manual when doing so. In addition, local governments can no longer zone exclusively for single-family or duplex dwellings, except in areas that are exempt from this legislation.The SSMUH legislation also prohibits local governments from:\n\tRequiring off-street parking or loading spaces for the residential use of housing units in areas, where a minimum allowable density of six units is required in proximity to frequent bus transit.\n\tUsing density bonusing to achieve the minimum densities they are required to permit under SSMUH zoning, except that they may use density bonusing to achieve one of the six units required to be permitted near frequent bus transit.\n\tHolding a public hearing on a zoning bylaw or amendments to a zoning bylaw proposed, for the sole purpose of complying with the SSMUH legislation.\nExemptions:Lands in a local trust area under the Islands Trust Act and rural land-use bylaws under Section 457 of the Local government Act are exempt from the requirements.Local governments can also exempt land that is subject to hazardous conditions, where an increase in density would increase the risk from the hazardous conditions, the risk cannot practically be mitigated and a local government has a report from a qualified professional, like an engineer, attesting to the risk.Local governments can also exempt areas from the requirements for three to six units for the following reasons:\n\tland that is protected under s. 12.1 (2) of the Heritage Conservation Act;\n\tland that is designated as protected under a bylaw made under LGA, s. 611 [heritage designation protection] at the time the legislation comes into force;\n\tlands subject to a heritage revitalization agreement at the time the legislation comes into force;\n\tland that is not connected to a water or sewer system (parcels must be connected to both) provided as a service by a municipality or regional district;\n\tland that is within a zone in respect of which the minimum lot size that may be created by subdivision is 4,050 m2;\n\ta parcel of land that is larger than 4,050 m2; and\n\tland that is within a prescribed Transit Oriented Area.\nThe minister of housing may grant extensions to local governments to update their zoning bylaws if:\n\tthe local government is in the process of upgrading infrastructure that services the specific area or specific lot which the extension is being requested;\n\tthe infrastructure that services the area where SSMUH would apply is such that compliance by June 30, 2024, is likely to increase a risk to health, public safety or the environment in that area; or\n\textraordinary circumstances exist that otherwise prevent compliance in relation to the area (example would be major wildfire or flood events).\nA policy bulletin with detailed application criteria and information on requesting an exemption will be made available in January 2024.Local governments that do not comply with the legislative requirements for SSMUH by the compliance deadline of June 30, 2024, may be subject to a ministerial order that overrides their zoning bylaw and permits the minimum density of use required under SSMUH, until such a time as the local government undertakes updates to come into compliance with the legislation[JB1] [KAH2] . Local governments must update the official community plan by Dec. 31, 2025.Site standards:To comply with the SSMUH legislation, local governments will need to update their zoning bylaws by June 30, 2024, unless an extension is granted by the minister of housing.To support local governments with this process, a series of site standards has been prepared that provide technical specifications commonly found in zoning bylaws. These site standards set provincial expectations for how local governments enable financially viable SSMUH developments by providing flexibility for builders and developers.Four site standards have been prepared based on the different SSMUH unit requirements set out in the legislation. For specific information about each site standards, review the Small-Scale Multi-Unit Housing Provincial Policy Manual Site Standards.The Provincial Policy Guidance Manual is a resource to support local governments with the implementation of Provincial Transit-Oriented Areas (TOA) requirements.The legislation requires local governments to consider this policy manual when doing the following within a TOA:\n\tdesignating TOAs by bylaws;\n\tadopting/amending zoning bylaws;\n\tadopting/amending OCP bylaws (development plans for Vancouver);\n\tadopting/amending parking regulations bylaw.\nAdditional guidance materials may be issued from time to time by the Province to assist local governments with implementing the TOA legislative requirements.Within those TOAs, local governments are required to adhere to minimum densities when amending a zoning bylaw or updating an Official Community Plan (OCP) or Official Development Plan (ODP).The regulations contain the prescribed TOA transit stations, some of which take effect immediately and others which take effect in June 2024. The regulations also establish a minimum density (MD) that must be allowed in TOAs. The MD will depend on the nature of the transit station (bus vs. rail) and the distance from the transit station.\n\n\tSky Train station TOAs include SkyTrain and subway stops and all include a catchment area of 800 metres measured as a radium from the centre of each station. SkyTrain TOAs encompass a gross land area of 200 hectares (ha) and are comprised of three distinct tiers:\n\t\n\t\tTier 1 encompasses a gross land area of 12.5 ha within 200 metres or less from the station.\n\t\tTier 2 encompasses a gross land area of 37.5 ha within 201-400 metres from the station.\n\t\tTier 3 encompasses a gross land area of 150 ha with 401- 800 metres from the station.\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\n\tBus Exchanges and West Coast Express Stations are TOA nodes that have a catchment area of 400 metres. They encompass a gross land area of 50 ha and are comprised of two distinct tiers.\n\t\n\t\tTier 4 encompasses a gross land are of 12.5 ha within 200 metres or less from the exchange.\n\t\tTier 5 encompasses a gross land area of 37.5 ha within 201-400 metres from the exchange.\n\t\n\t\n\n\nAll West Coast Express stops are considered TOAs. Bus-exchange locations were identified based on multiple service and infrastructure criteria, including:\n\n\t15-minutes service frequency (between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.);\n\ttwo or more unique line connections;\n\tservice 7 days a week (between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.);\n\tone route meeting minimum frequency at least 12 hours/day; and\n\tpermanent, purpose-built infrastructure.\nIf a bus stop or exchange does not meet this criteria, it is not considered a TOA.The Province developed the Minimum Allowable Density Framework (MD Framework), that sets out densities which local governments must allow when considering zoning bylaw or Official Community Plan (OCP) amendments.The MD Framework relies on two metrics to define minimum allowable density:\n\n\tdensity measured by Floor Area Ratio (FAR), and\n\tbuilding height measured in storeys.\n\n\nThe MD Framework does not change the existing rezoning process of a local government. Application fees, submission requirements, staff reporting, bylaw introduction and readings, public hearings and final adoption continue as before. Only density and height requirement are imposed by the new framework*.\nBill 47 restricts local government ability to require residential off-street parking in TOAs, except for parking for people with disabilities and to access services and amenities.\nUnder these guidelines and legislation 47, local governments must amend their Official Community Plans (OCP) to include TOA designations by June 30, 2024. If OCPs are amended to include corresponding densities outlined by the MD Framework and the Province requires all zoning bylaws to comply with OCPs by July 31, 2024, the MD Framework may only be in force for less than a year for some locations.\nThe regulations create four categories that municipalities fit into based on type of stop, size of municipality and transit-service provided.\nA summary of these categories is available here: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/HousingGuidelines_Regs_SummarySlides_V2.pdf  \nThe identified 31 municipalities that must designate TOAs and adopt the minimum allowable densities prescribed in the regulations are as follows:\n\n\tCity of Abbotsford\n\tCity of Burnaby \n\tCity of Chilliwack \n\tCity of Colwood\n\tCity of Coquitlam\n\tCity of Delta\n\tCity of Kamloops \n\tCity of Kelowna\n\tCity of Langford\n\tCity of Langley\n\tTownship of Langley\n\tDistrict of Lantzville\n\tCity of Maple Ridge \n\tCity of Mission\n\tCity of Nanaimo\n\tCity of New Westminster\n\tCity of North Vancouver\n\tDistrict of North Vancouver\n\tCity of Penticton\n\tCity of Pitt Meadows\n\tCity of Prince George\n\tCity of Port Coquitlam\n\tCity of Port Moody\n\tCity of Richmond\n\tDistrict of Saanich\n\tCity of Surrey\n\tCity of Vancouver\n\tCity of Vernon\n\tTown of View Royal\n\tCity of Victoria\n\tResort Municipality of Whistler\nThe guidance also includes a step-by-step guide for local government to appropriately designate all TOAs within their jurisdiction and implement the MD Framework.Local governments must pass a bylaw that designates each TOA in accordance with the LGA, including a map, plan or other graphic material by June 30, 2024, and notify the minister of housing in writing of the final adoption of the bylaw that is compliant with TOA requirements, including a copy of the bylaw.*Any rezoning application that has received First Reading by its respective local government before Jan. 1, 2024, will be exempt from the requirements of TOA Legislation 47 and Regulation 44.",

    "resolutionId": null,
    "meetingType": "Ministry of Housing",
    "contents": "COMOX – Seniors and people living with disabilities in Comox are moving into 52 new affordable and accessible rental homes with the opening of Cypress Gardens.“The north Island is not immune to the housing crisis and Cypress Gardens will give seniors and people who need accessible housing in the Comox Valley a safe and affordable place to live and age in place,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “Our government shares the community’s excitement in seeing the building open and will continue to work with our partners to support the housing needs for seniors and people living with disabilities throughout B.C.”Located at 1582 Balmoral Ave., the new three-storey wood-frame building is owned and operated by the Comox Valley Affordable Housing Society (CVAHS). The 52 one-bedroom units are for seniors 60 and older, and people of all ages living with disabilities. The building replaces a 16-unit townhouse complex owned by CVAHS, which was reaching the end of its lifespan, and more than triples the number of affordable housing units on the site and enhances the neighbourhood.“We are taking action to make sure people can stay in the communities where they have connections and feel safe and comfortable,” said Ronna-Rae Leonard, MLA for Courtenay-Comox. “Thank you to the Comox Valley Affordable Housing Society for their work to improve the quality of life for seniors and people living with disabilities. I look forward to seeing the difference these new innovative homes will make in our community for years to come.”Cypress Gardens was carefully designed to meet the needs of people with various disabilities that might affect mobility, vision and hearing. Twelve of the units are wheelchair accessible. The remaining units are adaptable, meaning they have been designed to easily accommodate future renovations to improve accessibility if the tenant’s needs change. The building has earned a certified gold rating under the Rick Hansen Foundation Accessibility Certification (RHFAC) program.“This building shows that with a bit of pre-planning, affordable housing can be made accessible to everyone,” said Ann Janssen, executive director, CVAHS. “By making housing accessible, we can enable people to thrive, making a difference in the lives of those with disabilities and seniors who wish to age in place.”The building features a large community room, an on-site office and a laundry facility on each floor. It is located close to downtown Comox, providing easy access to nearby shopping, medical care and recreational facilities.“Congratulations to the Comox Valley Affordable Housing Society for their RHF Accessibility Certified Gold achievement at Cypress Gardens,” said Brad McCannell, vice-president of Access and Inclusion, Rick Hansen Foundation. “This project demonstrates the kind of leadership needed to ensure our communities can accommodate people of all ages, incomes and abilities. An RHFAC gold environment delivers the aging-in-place solutions needed to support residents now and in the future.”Rent for half the units will be geared to income, where rent is 30% of the tenant’s income. Some of the units will be rented to households with very low incomes, such as those receiving income or disability assistance, or a basic senior’s pension. Others will be rented at affordable market rates, ranging from $1,400 to $1,450 per month.“We are delighted about the opening of Cypress Gardens,” said Nicole Minions, mayor of Comox. “We know the residents were eagerly anticipating completion and we warmly welcome them into their new homes. Its design, considerate of diverse abilities, proudly fosters an inclusive living space in our community.”This project is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes delivered or underway, including more than 800 in the Comox Valley.Quick Facts:\n\tThe Province, through BC Housing, provided approximately $5.2 million to the project through the Building BC: Community Housing Fund and will provide approximately $161,000 in annual operating funding.\n\tCVAHS provided $1.84 million in equity as well as the land, which was valued at $890,000 at the time of purchase.\n\nLearn More:To learn more about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing",

    "title": "New regulations make EV charging requests easier in strata developmentsUpdated on Dec. 6, 2023",
    "resolutionId": null,
    "meetingType": "Ministry of Housing",
    "contents": "VICTORIA – New regulations will make it easier for people living in strata developments to request electric-vehicle (EV) charging stations where they live.“Lack of access to electric-vehicle charging should not be a deterrent to people wanting to purchase or rent in a strata complex, which for some is a more affordable housing option,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister for Housing. “We’re ensuring that people living in strata developments have a process to request access to electric-vehicle charging, while also helping stratas to plan for and manage electrical capacity. We’re considering future need, adapting to climate change and building a low-carbon B.C.” The regulations outline a process for a homeowner in a strata to request to install an EV charging station and determine a timeline for strata corporations to respond. The regulations also enable strata corporations to grant permission to an owner to exclusively use a parking stall on common property on land that is a common asset for as long as five years if EV charging has been installed and the installation resulted from an owner’s request for EV charging.“British Columbians are choosing electric vehicles at record rates. In November, we passed legislative amendments to accelerate zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) targets and get more electric vehicles in B.C.,” said Josie Osborne, Minister of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation. “This regulation under the Strata Property Act helps make it easier for people who live in strata properties to go electric with a clearer pathway to accessing and installing EV charging stations right where they live.”Strata corporations will also be required to obtain an Electrical Planning Report (EPR), which will help stratas plan for future upgrades and demands on their electrical systems, such as conversion to heat pumps and installation of cooling equipment, and support resident requests for EV charging. Small stratas of fewer than five units will be exempt from the EPR requirement.“The upcoming regulations under the Strata Property Act provide a balanced solution to owners who want to purchase electric vehicles and require charging facilities,” said Tony Gioventu, CEO of Condominium Home Owners Association. “The EPR will allow strata corporations to plan for costs and operations associated with electric demand.”The EPR must include a range of information, including the current building electrical capacity, peak demand, spare capacity, future anticipated electricity demand, a list of systems powered by electricity (including EV charging stations), and recommendations about how to manage electrical capacity and demand. More information about the EPR requirements will be available online.The deadline for stratas to obtain an EPR will be phased in over several years. Stratas located in Metro Vancouver Regional District, Fraser Valley Regional District and the Capital Regional District (excluding the Gulf Islands) will be required to obtain an EPR by late 2026. Stratas located in other areas of the province will be required to obtain an EPR by late 2028.“Electric vehicles are a great option for British Columbians looking to reduce their impact on the environment, because 98% of the electricity BC Hydro generates comes from clean and renewable resources,” said Chris O’Riley, president and CEO of BC Hydro. “These new regulations will support EV adoption for people living in stratas and allow more British Columbians to charge their EVs at home.”These regulations also bring into force the remainder of Bill 22, the Strata Property Amendment Act introduced in spring 2023, which lowered the voting threshold from three-quarters approval to majority for approval of certain decisions related to the installation of electric-vehicle charging equipment.  The Strata Property Regulations support the Province’s CleanBC Roadmap to 2030 and its commitment to ensure that all new space- and water-heating equipment sold and installed in B.C. will be 100% efficient after 2035.  These regulations are effective as of Dec. 6, 2023.Learn More:To learn about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn more about the changes to electric-vehicle charging in strata corporations, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/strata-housing/operating-a-strata/the-environment/electric-vehicle-chargingTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/To learn about B.C.’s Go Electric EV charger rebate program and the full suite of Go Electric programming, visit: https://goelectricbc.gov.bc.caTo learn about B.C.'s Zero-Emission Vehicles Act, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/zeroemissionvehiclesFor more information about B.C. legislation, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/legislation",

    "title": "New code will make buildings safer, more accessible and resilient to climate changeUpdated on Dec. 5, 2023What to know about changes to the BC Building Code",
    "resolutionId": null,
    "meetingType": "Ministry of HousingMinistry of Housing",
    "contents": "VICTORIA – The Province adopted the British Columbia Building and Fire Codes (BC Codes 2024) to provide people with a greater level of building safety and to make new buildings more sustainable, resilient and accessible.“As we take historic steps to build more homes for people faster, we are also taking action to make sure homes are safe, accessible and more resilient to climate change,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “We have to find ways to innovate and build differently. Over the next year, the Province will lead a discussion on enabling single-egress stairs in the BC Building Code.”Key updates to the building code will require all new buildings to:\n\tprovide one living space that is designed not to exceed 26 C;\n\thave power-operated doors in all building entrances and universal washrooms; and\n\thave an elevator in all large two- and three-storey apartment buildings.\nAdditional updates to the building code focus on accessibility, mass-timber construction and radon safety.“We have seen evidence of extreme weather impacting our province and warmer temperatures because of climate change,” said Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer. “We need to find ways to protect people in B.C., especially those most at risk from being impacted by extreme heat, to have the supports they need to be safe. These adjustments to the BC Building Code are one measure that will help to ensure people in shared spaces have somewhere they can go to on hot days to stay cool and be better protected from hot weather. We know that heat can sneak up on us, so we want people to be as prepared as they can to find cool places when temperatures rise.”Most updates to the building code will come into effect provincewide on March 8, 2024. The implementation window will allow construction and housing-industry professionals more time to review the changes and complete any necessary training. It will also allow an easier transition for housing projects underway.The updates align with the new Residential Development Act, which includes small-scale, multi-unit housing (SSMUH) legislation that will allow three to four units on land currently zoned for single-family homes and duplexes, and as many as six units near bus stops with frequent transit service.The Province is deferring the effective date on the adaptable dwellings and earthquake-design changes to March 10, 2025, to provide a one-year transition period. This will allow the Ministry of Housing to work with interested parties and local governments to develop strategies to implement the new requirements.“Eliminating barriers to accessibility is a core motive in our efforts to making our province a safe and barrier-free place to live in,” said Susie Chant, Parliamentary Secretary for Accessibility. “We are taking action on what we’ve heard in our engagements with British Columbians, especially people living with disabilities. That is why we are updating the standards in our building code to support everyone in their day-to-day activities.”As the Province updates the building code, it continues to work to identify and review opportunities to support cost-effective and efficient construction of more new homes. The Province, along with fire-safety professionals and national partners, is examining opportunities in codes, including requirements for egress stairs. These opportunities may simplify the design of smaller multi-unit residential buildings and create options for quicker and more affordable construction, while maintaining or enhancing safety.The BC Building Code is a provincial regulation that governs how a building’s construction, alterations and demolitions are required to be carried out. The code establishes minimum requirements for safety, health, accessibility, fire and structural protection of buildings, and energy and water efficiency.Quotes:Brad McCannell, vice-president of access and inclusion, Rick Hansen Foundation –“The Rick Hansen Foundation is pleased to have contributed input into the proposed changes to the BC Building Code. The updates are welcomed by people with varying disabilities and we applaud the Government of B.C.’s continued commitment towards improved meaningful accessibility for people of all ages and abilities.”Larry Clay, chairperson, SAFERhome Standards Society –“What we build today defines our tomorrow. A tomorrow where everyone, regardless of their age, size, ability or mobility, can enjoy their home. The Province of B.C. stands as an exemplar of innovation, inclusivity and foresight, showcasing the kind of progress imperative for addressing today's evolving housing needs. There is much work ahead and we eagerly anticipate collaborating with the Province of B.C., municipalities and builders, ensuring proper training and implementation to make universal housing a reality for all.”Anne McMullin, president and CEO, Urban Development Institute (UDI) –“UDI and members of the building industry have actively engaged with the Ministry of Housing over the last year on these changes and we are pleased that the ministry is taking additional time to ensure the seismic and accessibility provisions can be implemented in a cost-effective and efficient way. We look forward to continuing to work with the ministry on opportunities to deliver homes and job spaces quicker and more affordably.”Helaine Boyd, executive director, Disability Alliance BC –“Disability Alliance BC (DABC) is looking forward to witnessing how these BC Building Code changes will directly impact the lives of people with disabilities in need of accessible housing. We hope that the BC Building Code changes will continue conversations and ultimately contribute to greater social and economic inclusion for people with disabilities in our province.”Quick Facts: \n\tThe changes include updates to Plumbing Systems Book II and adoption of the National Fire Code 2020 as the BC Fire Code.\n\tThe BC Building Code applies across the province, except on some federal lands and in the City of Vancouver, which has its own building bylaw.\n\tAdoption of the new BC Codes follows an 11-week public engagement on accessibility from October 2021 until January 2022, and a four-week public review in spring 2023, which invited interested parties to review and comment on a variety of proposed building-code changes. A second engagement happened in October 2023 to explore the impact of earthquake-design changes.\n\tThe four-week technical review in spring 2023 resulted in 251 responses, the majority of which indicated that the proposals were clear and buildable.\nLearn More: To learn about the new BC Codes, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/construction-industry/building-codes-standards/bc-codes  To read the summary report on feedback received during early engagement on accessibility, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/construction-industry/building-codes-standards/resources-contactinformation  To learn about the Province’s work to digitize the BC Building Code, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000496A backgrounder follows.The Province is adopting changes to the BC Building Code (BC Code), a provincial regulation that governs how buildings in B.C. get built. Most code changes will come into effect on March 8, 2024, except for adaptable dwellings and earthquake-design changes which will come into effect on March 10, 2025.A summary of the changes to new residential buildings:Accessibility:\n\tPower-operated doors in all building entrances and universal washrooms.\n\tAn elevator in all large two- and three-storey apartment buildings.\n\tDesignated wheelchair spaces in event facilities.\n\tMore inclusive signage to increase wayfinding and building safety.\n\tFull-size change tables in universal washrooms.\n\tAssisted-listening systems for people with hearing loss.\nCooling requirements:\n\tAll new residential buildings must provide one living space that is designed not to exceed 26 C. This may require a cooling appliance in many parts of the province, depending on weather and site conditions.\nMass-timber construction:\n\tThe Province has permitted the use of mass-timber buildings, in harmonization with the National Building Code 2020, across B.C.\nRadon safety:\n\tProvincewide adoption of a rough-in for a radon-extraction system.\nThe Province is deferring the effective date on adaptable dwellings and earthquake-design changes to March 10, 2025, to provide a one-year transition period.Adaptable dwellings:Adaptable dwellings are designed and built with features that can be changed to meet occupants’ needs, allowing them to stay in their homes through illness, injury, and/or aging.\n\tAll residential suites in large residential buildings and ground-floor suites in small apartment buildings will have:\n\t\taccessible clearances through doorways and along paths of travel to living spaces;\n\t\tmanoeuvring space in a bedroom, bathroom and kitchen;\n\t\tswitches and other controls at an accessible height; and\n\t\treinforcement of bathroom walls to allow future installation of grab bars.\n\t\n\tModest increases for smaller residential housing, such as single-detached homes, townhomes and row homes, will require:\n\t\treinforcement of bathroom walls to allow future installation of grab bars.\n\t\nEarthquake design:\n\tNew methodologies for earthquake design for small buildings, in harmonization with the National Building Code.\n\tThese changes respond to increased earthquake risks and new national standards to protect new buildings and life safety.",

Checkpoints will be set up on Highway 1 just outside of Hope and Lytton to advise motorists about the detour routes and assist local traffic.Drivers heading between the Lower Mainland and B.C.’s Interior can use Highway 3 (Hope-Princeton Highway) or Highway 5 (Coquihalla Highway). However, drivers are cautioned winter driving conditions, including snow and rain, are forecast for both routes.Winter tires or chains are required on most routes in British Columbia from Oct. 1 until April 30. Anyone travelling between the Lower Mainland and Interior should ensure their vehicle is properly equipped for winter and be prepared for delays by carrying food, water and blankets.Drivers can assist maintenance crews by moving over safely when they see a vehicle with an amber light approaching. This will allow maintenance crews to clear the snow and improve road conditions to reduce hazards, and help motorists get safely to their destinations.For up-to-date information about road conditions, drivers are encouraged to follow @DriveBC on X (formerly Twitter) and check: https://www.drivebc.ca/",

Update on Proposed Provincial Housing Legislation\n\nGeneral Manager, Planning and Development, City of Surrey provided a\nPowerPoint presentation regarding updates on proposed provincial housing\nlegislation and highlighted the following information:\n\n• Bill 44, Residential Development Bill, permits secondary suites or accessory\nunits on every single family lot. Bill 44 sets up further regulation\npermitting 3, 4 or 6 units on each single family lot depending on lot size\nand proximity to transit. Provincial government requires cities to update\nZoning Bylaw to permit “missing middle” housing consistent with\nlegislation by June 2024. Zoning Bylaw must also be amended to\naccommodate 20-year housing supply, consistent with Official Community\nPlan (OCP) by end of 2025. New legislation will prohibit the City requiring\na public hearing on residential rezonings that are consistent with an OCP.\n\n• Bill 46, Development Finance Bill, adds eligible development cost charge\ncategories for fire halls, police facilities, and solid waste facilities that are\ncurrently funded through property taxation or community amenity\ncontributions (CACs). New amenity cost charges to replace CACs for\nrecreation centres, libraries, daycares and other social infrastructures.\n\n• Bill 47, Transit Oriented Areas Bill, requires local governments to define\nTransit Oriented Areas around \"rapid transit stations\" and \"bus exchanges\"\nby June 30, 2024. Staff must ensure zoning bylaws and OCP have permitted\ndensity and height conforms to standards set out in policy manual.",

The rover has a two-part folding design to meet the\ndesigner requirements and there will be two drivers, one male and one\nfemale, as per NASA requirements. The obstacles consist of challenges\nincluding undulating terrain which is a set of several gradual ingress and\negress slopes varying from six inches to twelve inches in height.\n\n• As a team their goal is to raise $50,000 to make this challenge a reality and\nrequest $15,000 from the City of Surrey. The funding will be utilized to\ncomplete the construction and transportation of the rover from Surrey to\nAlabama.",

    "contents": "VICTORIA – More Indigenous people will soon have new affordable rental homes on and off reserve as the Province is inviting Indigenous housing providers, First Nations and other Indigenous organizations to submit proposals for the Building BC: Indigenous Housing Fund (IHF).“In 2018, we became the first province in Canada to invest in First Nations’ housing on reserve, a federal jurisdiction,” said Ravi Kahlon, Minister of Housing. “With this latest call for proposals, we’re proud to be building on that work and partnering with the Indigenous housing sector to ensure Indigenous people everywhere in B.C. have access to the safe and affordable housing they need. This is one of the ways we are moving forward on reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples in B.C.”The IHF provides approximately $1.8 billion to build 3,500 new homes for Indigenous families, individuals and elders, on and off reserve. To date, more than 1,500 IHF homes are open or underway throughout B.C. BC Housing will accept proposals for the IHF until April 30, 2024, to ensure adequate time for applicants to prepare submissions. The proposals will be evaluated and projects totalling approximately 1,200 units are expected to be announced by summer 2024. Projects will be prioritized based on several criteria, including residential and regional housing needs.“The Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs (UBCIC) welcomes and fully appreciates the announcement from the Province that new affordable homes will soon be available for First Nations,” said Grand Chief Stewart Philip, UBCIC. “There remains much work to do and the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs is committed to working with the Ministry of Housing, as they carry out their Declaration Act Action Plan commitments in ensuring that all First Nations have a safe and affordable place to call home.”Indigenous non-profit housing providers, First Nations, other Indigenous organizations, and non-profit and for-profit developers wanting to partner with Indigenous organizations and First Nations interested in creating new affordable rental units for Indigenous people are encouraged to submit their housing proposals and apply for funding.To assist with housing proposals, a new application form and process is available for non-profit societies, housing co-ops, municipal housing providers, First Nations and Indigenous governments to apply for early access to project-development funding. This funding is for organizations that need additional financial or operational support to advance their affordable housing project such as hiring an architect or design consultant to create a more fully formed and competitive proposal.The IHF is part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes that have been delivered or are underway.Quick Facts:\n\tThis is the second request for proposals (RFP) for the Indigenous Housing Fund. The first RFP was announced in November 2018.\n\tIn June 2018, the Province announced an investment of approximately $550 million over 10 years to build and operate 1,750 units of social housing for Indigenous people, both on and off reserve.\n\tThe Province invested an additional $1.3 billion through Budget 2023 to double the number of IHF spaces, bringing the total to 3,500.\n\tIn addition to the Indigenous Housing Fund, Indigenous housing providers are encouraged to submit proposals to all Building BC funding programs.\nLearn More:To learn about Building BC: Indigenous Housing Fund, visit: https://www.bchousing.org/projects-partners/Building-BC/IHFFor information about IHF Request for Proposals, visit: https://www.bchousing.org/IHF-RFPTo learn about about Project Development Fund, visit: https://www.bchousing.org/projects-partners/funding-opportunities/project-development-fundTo learn about government’s new Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/",

We’re proud to be working in partnerships to build homes like these to make sure everyone in this province, especially women who need financial stability, can access homes they can afford.”The project is a partnership between the Province, through BC Housing, the federal government, through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, Soroptimist International of Vancouver, the City of Vancouver and Purpose Driven Development.The redevelopment at 550 West 13th Ave. will replace an aging 21-unit building with a 13-storey, 135-unit tower, for a net increase of 114 new affordable homes. It will have a mix of studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments to support families of different sizes.The building will be owned and operated by Soroptomist International of Vancouver, an organization focused on women that supports women with low incomes achieving financial independence and housing security. The society also operated the previous building on this site and will offer all previous tenants the opportunity to move into these new homes.“We’re focused on improving the lives of women by providing access to education and training to achieve economic empowerment,” said Carla Busnardo, board member, Soroptimist International of Vancouver. “Our innovative project empowers women through holding a lease in their name and supports families to achieve financial independence. Vancouver Soroptimists are helping women be their best by providing affordable housing.”Residents will have access to a range of amenities, including indoor and outdoor gathering spaces, a rooftop patio and shared working spaces, along with flexible space for educational classes, activities and events to support a positive community. Construction is expected to be complete in 2026.“Affordable housing projects like this for women and children are long overdue and welcome news in Vancouver,” said George Heyman, MLA for Vancouver-Fairview. “Everyone deserves access to affordable, stable housing, and this project is the latest step in our work to provide homes for people and families on fixed incomes. We know there is more to do and we’re going to keep working with our partners to deliver thousands of homes here and across the province.”These homes are part of a $19-billion housing investment by the B.C. government. Since 2017, the Province has more than 77,000 homes delivered or underway, including nearly 8,000 in Vancouver.Quotes: Sean Fraser, federal Minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities –  “Today, we can see the positive impact of the National Housing Strategy, with 135 new homes designed by, for and with women in Vancouver. These homes are not just bricks and mortar, but a symbol of hope and empowerment for women who need a safe and affordable place to call home. This project is creating a community where women can thrive and support each other, while starting new chapters in their lives, and that is something we can all be proud of.”  Taleeb Noormohamed, MP for Vancouver-Granville – “Access to secure housing has a profound impact on an individual’s well-being, their ability to pursue opportunities, and their connection to the community. I am proud that all levels of government are coming together to provide new affordable homes for women here in Vancouver. Together, we build a stronger and more vibrant community where everyone has a place to call home.” Ken Sim, mayor of Vancouver – “Secure housing provides individuals and families with a stable foundation and fosters strong, connected communities. This is such an important project, when we invest in women and girls, we are investing in our own future. By fostering an atmosphere where women and girls can thrive, we lay the groundwork for a more equitable and resilient Vancouver.”Carla Guerrera, CEO and founder, Purpose Driven Development –“We’re proud to be the development lead for this remarkable project working to close the glaring gap in the housing needs of women by providing affordable housing delivered by women for women. In a male-dominated sector, this project demonstrates the leadership of highly qualified women professionals across the development sector.”Learn More:Interested tenants can apply for the housing online:\nhttps://www.soroptimistvancouver.org/housing-for-women-by-women/To learn about Homes for People action plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023HOUS0019-000436To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit:\nhttps://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/housing/For information about Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), visit\nhttps://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/enTo learn about the National Housing Strategy, visit: https://www.placetocallhome.ca/For the most requested Government of Canada housing information, visit: https://Canada.ca/housingA backgrounder follows.\n\tThe Province is providing $14.1 million through the Building BC: Community Housing Fund, and will provide annual operating funding.\n\t\tThe Community Housing Fund is a $3-billion investment to build more than 20,000 affordable rental homes for people with moderate and low incomes.\n\t\tApproximately 9,000 of these homes are open or underway throughout the province.\n\t\n\tThe federal government, through the National Housing Co-Investment Fund, is providing $9.94 million to this project.\n\tThe City of Vancouver is providing $6 million through its Community Housing Investment program and $3 million in development cost levy exemptions.\n\tThe Federation of Canadian Municipalities’ Green Municipal Fund, endowed by the Government of Canada, is providing a $175,000 grant for the study of the building of energy-efficient, affordable housing units.\n\tThe National Housing Co-Investment Fund is a $13.2-billion program under the National Housing Strategy that gives priority to projects that help people who need it most, including women and children fleeing family violence, seniors, Indigenous Peoples, people with disabilities, those with mental-health or addiction issues, veterans and young adults.\n\t\tCanada’s National Housing Strategy is a 10-year, $82-billion-plus plan that will give more Canadians a place to call home.",

An increase in height clearance will match the adjacent northbound crossing, which will allow for the passage of taller transport vehicles on the Ferry Avenue underpass.Other works included widening the shoulders and replacing the existing railings on both sides with crash-tested bridge barriers. The improvements make the structure more reliable for approximately 18,000 vehicles that cross daily.“Making this passage safer and more reliable has a huge impact on the people that rely on this crossing to get to and from their work and families,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “It also means our northern industries have better options for transport. The Simon Fraser Bridge is a historic crossing, and modernizing this structure means all travellers in the North can count on this passage long into the future.”The original Simon Fraser Bridge was built in 1963 as part of Highway 97. In 2009, the bridge was twinned with an adjacent two-lane bridge, which brought four-lane capacity to the crossing that serves north and south Prince George.The bridge continues to act as a key link for the northern supply chain, including movement of commercial goods into and out of the North. The improvements will create an easier passage to better support the transportation, forestry, mining and oil and gas sectors.Learn More:For more project information, visit: https://www.gov.bc.ca/simonfraserbridgeproject",

    "contents": "VICTORIA – The benefits and effects of people using e-scooters will be studied in detail to help more local governments across B.C. evaluate how this clean and popular mode of personal transportation can be safely integrated into local transportation networks.“E-scooters are part of an ongoing shift toward electric personal mobility that’s reducing emissions by giving people new clean and affordable options to get around,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “We’re making it easier for local governments to test e-scooters on their own roads, so we can ensure future regulations represent the needs of people across the province.”The safety review will start on April 5, 2024, and run for four years. The review replaces the first phase of the e-scooter pilot project that began in 2021, where the use of electric kick scooters was tested in 13 participating communities over a three-year period. The review enables the collection of better health and safety data, which is needed to address outstanding questions about the safe integration of e-scooters into transportation networks. This will help determine if and how electric kick scooters should be permanently authorized for general use in B.C.During the next four-year period, people will be able to legally use e-scooters in any community that authorizes their use. Participating communities will continue to prescribe how and where electric kick scooters can be used, subject to new regulations. A new streamlined onboarding process will make it easier for smaller and rural communities to test electric kick scooters and address local needs.Visit the project website to find out if electric kick scooters are authorized for use in your community: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/transportation-environment/active-transportation/scooter“Use of e-scooters for personal transportation is growing in communities across B.C.,” said councillor Trish Mandewo, president, Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM). “Local governments have asked the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure to work with them to ensure that appropriate regulation is in place and will welcome the findings the pilot projects will yield. UBCM appreciates this collaborative and constructive effort to address a critical shift in public transportation.”During the next phase of examination, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure will lead an ongoing safety evaluation, together with government partners, ICBC and the BC Injury Research and Prevention Unit (BCIRPU). This work will complement safety evaluations supplied by communities participating in the review.“The BCIRPU is pleased to partner with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure on this important project to evaluate e-scooter safety data relating to injuries,” said Dr. Ian Pike, director, BC Injury Research and Prevention Unit. “This project will clarify any safety and injury concerns, advance our understanding of micromobility and determine whether e-scooters can be a viable mode of transportation on our roads.”The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure will be hosting outreach sessions with interested local governments over the coming months to provide information and encourage participation.Quick Facts:\n\tElectric kick scooters are battery-powered devices with a motor, two to four wheels, a platform for standing and handlebars for steering.\n\tElectric kick scooters are a form of active transportation that has been shown to reduce vehicle trips and help support connections to public transportation.\n\tOntario and Quebec are also evaluating the use of electric kick scooters.\n\tAmendments to the Motor Vehicle Act passed in spring 2023 establish a new legislative framework for testing new and emerging forms of active transportation.\n\tThe government began the first stage of the project in 2021 to test the use of electric kick scooters in participating communities for a three-year period.\nLearn More: For more information about the electric kick scooter pilot project, visit https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/transportation-environment/active-transportation/scooterThe Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure has been collecting and analyzing the results of the first two years of the pilot project. Interim data has been provided by participating communities and a public opinion survey was conducted by Angus Reid Group.Interim findings to date:British Columbians support the testing of electric kick scooters:A majority of British Columbians surveyed see these devices as improving their transportation options. Electric kick scooters represent a convenient and relatively affordable mode of transportation, whether used for commuting, running errands or simply for pleasure.Electric kick scooters have environmental benefits:Data from participating communities indicate these devices promote active, clean transportation and reduce carbon footprint. For example:\n\tKelowna recorded more than 600,000 trips by electric kick scooters and other micromobility devices in approximately two years, 48% of which replaced vehicle trips.\n\tVernon reported more than 470,000 kilometres travelled by users of its shared electric kick scooter provider, with 50% of users using the devices to commute.\nParticipating communities have higher levels of support:More than two-thirds of British Columbians surveyed are supportive of the project, especially in participating communities. Residents in participating communities also have greater awareness of the project. They said they were more likely to use these devices and were satisfied with available clean-transportation choices.Electric kick scooters can help meet sustainable transportation goals:Most participating communities have policies supporting clean transportation and see electric kick scooters as enhancing connections to public transit and addressing gaps in existing transportation networks. Local governments are also using their participation as a way to test e-bike/bike shared-service programs in their community. More data is needed to assess electric kick scooter safety and reductions in vehicle trips.Injuries and conflicts with other road users are rare when operators follow the rules: National data provided by a shared-service provider indicate that 99.9% of electric kick scooter trips end without incident. Of the 0.01% trips during which an incident occurs, only 1.5% are severe (needing more than 24-hour hospitalization). To date, there have been no fatalities in B.C.Overall awareness of the project and electric kick scooter laws is low:Less than one-third of British Columbians surveyed are aware of the pilot project and rules for electric kick scooters. Greater public education and awareness is needed to support compliance.",

We’re proud to celebrate Canada’s contribution of up to $1.3 billion alongside our partners with whom we will continue to collaborate on funding projects that will improve the livability in our region and ensure a lower emission future for our country.”The Surrey Langley SkyTrain project is a 16-kilometre extension of the Expo Line that will run from King George Station to Langley City Centre, the first rapid transit expansion south of the Fraser River in 30 years. Once complete, commuters will be able to travel on transit from Langley city to downtown Vancouver in just over an hour.“This is another important step in moving this project forward from concept to reality,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “The Surrey Langley SkyTrain is going to transform the way people live, work and travel both south of the Fraser and around the region. The stations we are naming today will become community landmarks and will be recognized for decades to come.”SkyTrain station names are selected by TransLink and made easily identifiable to make it simpler for transit riders to navigate the system.“It’s estimated 50,000 new residents will continue to move into Metro Vancouver every single year,” said Brad West, mayor of Port Coquitlam and chair of the Mayors’ Council. “By investing in public transit we are helping make the lives of these new British Columbians easier while simultaneously improving the quality of life and travel for everyone else.”The station name development process included mapping exercises, stakeholder consultation, community and neighbourhood plan reviews, and a study of land-use policies to better understand future development in areas surrounding the stations.The areas adjacent to new stations are key locations where the Province will support transit-oriented developments to create efficient, vibrant communities where people can rely on public transit to connect them to their work and social lives.The project is being delivered through three separate contracts: the guideway; the stations; and the systems and trackwork. Earlier this year, the Province announced the firms that were selected to respond to the requests for proposals. It’s anticipated that contracts will be awarded in early 2024.Advance work has been underway since 2020, including the now-complete widening of Fraser Highway between 140 and 148 streets, as well as utility relocations.Construction on the Surrey Langley SkyTrain is expected to begin in 2024.Quotes: Ken Hardie, MP for Fleetwood-Port Kells –“The Surrey Langley SkyTrain extension will reimagine public transit for Metro Vancouver residents. Once complete, the extension will better connect the communities of Surrey and Langley, minimize travel time, create jobs and get more cars off the road. We are proud to be a part of announcing the names for eight new SkyTrain stations and to celebrate another step forward in a project that will positively impact British Columbians.”Kevin Quinn, CEO, TransLink  –“By announcing station names for the Surrey Langley SkyTrain line, we have crossed yet another important milestone. I am excited to see public transit expanding to more communities in our region and with the station names unveiled today we are one step closer to delivering this much needed service.”Brenda Locke, mayor of Surrey –“New rapid transit is long overdue in Surrey and we look forward to this project breaking ground. The 16-kilometre Surrey Langley SkyTrain extension project will bring critically needed transportation options to the growing communities of Fleetwood, Clayton and Cloverdale. Surrey is pleased to have six of the eight stations along the route, which will improve transit accessibility south of the Fraser River, as well as connect more people to housing, employment and schools.Nathan Pachal, mayor of Langley –“Langley city residents are excited about the arrival of SkyTrain to our community that will be integrated to the bus rapid transit route to the Langley City Centre Station at the heart of downtown Langley city. The SkyTrain cements Willowbrook and Langley city as the eastern downtown of Metro Vancouver, and will be a business accelerator, supporting our vibrant, healthy, people-first, safe community.”Eric Woodward, mayor of Township of Langley –“The Surrey Langley SkyTrain extension is a long overdue investment and expansion in the region. For too long, commuters in Surrey and the Township of Langley have had few options to get around. We look forward to future progress on this project, and the recently announced Langley-Maple Ridge bus rapid transit route connecting to the future SkyTrain network.”Learn More:For information about Surrey Langley SkyTrain, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation-projects/surrey-langley-skytrainFor photos and videos about the project, visit: https://www.flickr.com/photos/tranbc/albums/72177720298782138",
