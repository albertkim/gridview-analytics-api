The application exceeds the anticipated height and density, but staff support it based on the changing context, emerging directions in the Vancouver Plan, and the delivery of 357 secured rental housing units including a portion of below-market units. The report recommends referring the rezoning application and plans to Public Hearing with the recommendation of the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability to approve the application, subject to conditions. The Director of Legal Services is instructed to prepare the necessary by-laws for consideration at the Public Hearing, including a Housing Agreement By-law and an amendment to the Noise Control By-law.",
