Calendino, Chair\nCouncillor A. Gu, Vice Chair\n\nMeeting April 8, 2024\nCOMMITTEE REPORT\nTO: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE (FMC)\nFROM: CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER\nSUBJECT: IT PROJECT PORTFOLIO STATUS UPDATE\nPURPOSE: To provide an update on the status of major capital IT projects\nRECOMMENDATION: THAT the report titled \"IT Project Portfolio Status Update\" dated April 8, 2024, be received for information.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe purpose of this report is to update Committee and Council on the status of major active 2024 capital Information Technology (IT) projects delivered by IT in collaboration with City departments and provide a look ahead at their upcoming work plan and schedule.\n1.0 POLICY SECTION\nNot applicable.\n2.0 BACKGROUND\nSince March 2023, IT has reported to the Financial Management Committee on major IT capital projects. In 2024, these reports will be provided on a quarterly basis. The following information is an update on IT projects for January to March 2024.\n3.0 GENERAL INFORMATION\n3.1 IT Project Descriptions and Project Status Updates\n3.1.1 911 Phone System Upgrade (NG911)\nProject Sponsor: Dave Critchley\nProject Manager: Doug Scharley\nDescription: This project replaces the existing 911 phone dispatch system with the newer phone technology that supports digital Next Generation 911 (NG911). The transition to the Next Generation 911 system is mandated by Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) and must be completed by March 2025.\nStatus Update: The Statement of Work with Netagen is in progress to be signed. Netagen has provided a detailed plan/schedule that is being integrated with the Next Generation 911 Program. The high availability of Primary and Live Secondary sites for both the data centers and dispatch centers has been confirmed. The Primary sites are on schedule to be ready for Netagen to commence the Next Generation 911 system installation in April 2024. The Next Generation 911 system is scheduled to be installed and tested by September 2024. Planning has commenced with TELUS for onboarding and commissioning timeline. The forecasted completion date of the project is November 2024.\nLGA (Local Government Authority) Agreement Update: The GVRD (Metro Vancouver) will be signing the LGA Agreement with TELUS for NG911 Emergency Services on behalf of all municipalities. The City's legal team is reviewing the contract and will provide advice and guidance on how to proceed.\n3.1.2 Development Approval & Permitting Solution Modernization (DAPSM)\nProject Sponsor: Jesse Dill\nProject Manager: Roseline Dias\nDescription: The project's objective is to modernize the City's permitting, application and approvals system to improve the internal and external user experience and to provide significant and measurable benefits to our citizens. The team worked closely with the City's Development Approvals Process (DAP) team and the project consultants, KPMG, to align the recommendations of the DAP report with the opportunities for continuous improvement in our EnerGov permitting software. This project has multiple phases: Phase 1 and Phase 2 were successfully delivered in 2023; Phase 3 is currently in progress and will deliver multiple business outcomes.\nStatus Update: In January 2024, privacy improvements were made to the My Permits Portal by tagging existing files already in the system so that only internal staff have access. This change also enables the upload of new attachments to applications post-submission by City's permit clients. Revenue Services benefited from automation to inform Tax when a new laneway permit is issued. The Building Department has visibility to the new permit status of \"preauthorized\" in-law suites. Effective February 2024, citizens can apply for Active Patio Permits (Boulevard, Curbside, and Sidewalk) and Engineering Residential Pre-Application approvals using the My Permits Portal. The Animal Issues Code Case Type was launched and access to new Animal Control Officers was provided for the benefit of community safety. A Finance report and four Engineering reports were added to the system to have improved visibility for business operational insights.\nIn March, a key milestone will be achieved with the Province. The City of Burnaby will be onboarded with the newly developed building permitting hub tool. This project is in alignment with City's efforts to streamline and standardize building permit processes in collaboration with other municipalities and the Province.\nAt the end of April, we expect to complete the upgrade of EnerGov to the latest version which will lead to enhanced product features and functionality, including Tyler Identity Client capability that enables single sign-on to allow applicants to use their existing social media log-ins.\n3.1.3 Customer Service Centre (CSC)\nProject Sponsor: Noreen Kassam\nProject Manager: Dario Sumano\nDescription: The Customer Service Centre (CSC) Project will centralize the intake, management and tracking of all service requests, inquiries, and feedback from City customers with an aim to improve external customer service and operational efficiency. The project will achieve this by deploying a centralized multi-channel customer service center with web, mobile app, phone, and in-person offerings, all managed by dedicated customer service staff.\nStatus Update: The Customer Service Center project team achieved significant milestones in 2023. They successfully completed division onboardings for Community Safety, Parking, Bylaw and Animal Control. Additionally, the project focused on streamlining case entry back to Engineering Transportation.\nThe team has ambitious goals for onboarding in Q2 of 2024. They plan to onboard divisions related to Crime Prevention and Anti-Graffiti. From a technology perspective, the project team made substantial progress by fulfilling most of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) requirements for an in-house Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. Leveraging these insights, we devised a strategy to engage vendor partners for implementing an off-the-shelf CRM solution. The CSC project created two Request for Proposals (RFPs) for licensing and implementation, aiming to deliver detailed plans and milestones for each major capability.\nThe project engaged vendors within a defined scope, budget, and timeline. The objective is to explore all available options to benefit the CSC Department and accelerate project results. Anticipating future needs, the CSC project plans to collaborate with vendors to build additional capabilities, such as Workforce Management and Quality Management to be enabled alongside the CRM soon after its implementation slated for 2025.\n3.1.4 Enterprise Content Management (ECM) & Governance System\nProject Sponsor: Juli Halliwell\nProject Manager: Saad Khan\nDescription: This project will transform the way the City stores and manages its documents, records, and other content. The new solution will look to increase staff efficiency by reducing time-consuming tasks around records storage and retrieval, augment compliance with applicable legislation and regulatory requirements, and improve the overall management and governance of the City's information assets.\n",

REPORT The Financial Management Committee, at its meeting held on April 8, 2024, received and adopted the attached report providing an update on the current status of major civic building projects. On behalf of the Financial Management Committee, Councillor P. Calendino Chair Councillor A. Gu Vice Chair Meeting April 8, 2024 File: 4230-01 COMMITTEE REPORT TO: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE (FMC) FROM: GENERAL MANAGER LANDS AND FACILITIES SUBJECT: MAJOR CIVIC BUILDING PROJECTS STATUS UPDATE PURPOSE: To provide an update on the current status of major civic building projects. RECOMMENDATION THAT the report titled \"Major Civic Building Projects Status Update\" dated April 8, 2024, be received for information. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The purpose of this report is to update Committee and Council on the current status of major civic building projects administered by the Civic Building Projects division, and to provide a look ahead at the upcoming work plan and schedule for these projects. 1.0 POLICY SECTION The advancement of these projects aligns with the following Council-adopted policies: Corporate Strategic Plan (2017), Regional Context Statement (2013), Official Community Plan (1998), Economic Development Strategy (2007), Social Sustainability Strategy (2011) and the Environmental Sustainability Strategy (2016). 2.0 BACKGROUND Major civic building projects progress through the following three major development phases: 1. Planning - this phase includes work such as project identification, needs assessment, site selection, business case development, geotechnical, environmental, transportation studies and site planning to validate that the proposed site can accommodate the full building program. 2. Design - in this phase, the preferred development strategies are confirmed with a schematic design study, then the design is developed further to a level of detail suitable for construction. City development approvals are obtained during this phase. 3. Construction - in this phase, contract documents such as budgets, schedules and costs are agreed with the selected general contractor, and the project is advanced through to occupancy. Upon completion of the project, the new facility is handed over to the user department to operate and administer the programs and/or services. 3.0 GENERAL INFORMATION The following is a visual representation of the schedules of major civic building projects identifying the development phases outlined in Section 3.0: 3.1 South Burnaby Rosemary Brown Arena The Rosemary Brown Arena is located in Edmonds Town Centre at the northwest corner of 10th Avenue and 18th Street. The facility features two NHL-sized pads that can accommodate both ice and dry surfaces, for ice sports as well as lacrosse, ball hockey, in-line hockey, community events and city-run programs, and 411 spectator seats. In addition, the facility includes a skate shop, concessions, instructors' office, two multi-purpose rooms, a patio roof deck, universal gender-neutral washrooms, a warm-side arena viewing, and public lobby and reception. Sustainable design features and water conservation strategies will help minimize the Rosemary Brown Arena's environmental footprint. Electric Vehicle Charging stalls and parking for bicycles will also be available. Provisional occupancy was granted in late December. Full occupancy is expected once outstanding items on the roof-top patio are complete. Daily site visits and weekly meetings continue with all parties to ensure the remaining deficiencies are completed as soon as possible. Recreation staff have moved into the building and are setting up furniture and training staff. Programming is open for registration with registered programs expected to begin in April. 3.2 Confederation Park Covered Sports Box This project will replace the current outdoor lacrosse courts at Confederation Park with a covered multisport box. The existing lacrosse box at Confederation Park has reached its end-of-life and requires replacement. The scope includes demolishing and replacing the existing lacrosse box with a new multi-sport covered box. This new facility will provide a very wide range of services and is already attracting usage requests by a diverse number of groups. Recreation staff are developing schedules and allocation of space and time for the future uses of this building which may include lacrosse, ball hockey, pickleball, tai chi, summer camps and more. The project has achieved substantial completion and remaining deficiencies are currently being completed. Remaining works include installation of netting, final inspection and obtaining occupancy. 3.3 Riverway Covered Sports Box Located at Riverway Sports Complex, the project involves the design and construction to cover the existing multisport court and provide covered space for spectator seating. Construction is nearing completion and is expected to be finalized in Q1 2024. Remaining works include BC Hydro meter installation, commissioning, and final inspection for occupancy. 3.4 Fire Hall #4 (Duthie Avenue) The Burnaby Fire Department Needs Assessment Study (2020) provided an analysis of the current state and needs of the department. The replacement of the existing Fire Hall #4 on Duthie Avenue was identified as a priority project and the site approved for its replacement is 1551 Greystone Drive. Construction is nearing completion with works expected to be finalized in Q1 2024. Ongoing activities include completion of electrical distribution and BC Hydro connection, gym flooring, interior glazing, and millwork. Upcoming work includes painting, door installation, grading, and landscaping. 3.5 Fire Hall #8 (Burnaby Mountain) The Burnaby Fire Department Needs Assessment Study (2020) provided an analysis of the current state and needs of the department. The construction of a new Fire Hall #8 at Simon Fraser University (SFU) was identified as a priority project to improve response coverage to Burnaby Mountain and reduce the risk posed by the varied land uses on Burnaby Mountain, including institutional, industrial, multi-family residential and wildland interface. Construction works are progressing with structural steel welding, framing, and formwork underway. Archeological soils have been removed from site. Upcoming works include further excavation and plumbing. Construction is anticipated to be complete in Q2 2024.\n",

Forty-five residents responded to the survey that was run in conjunction with the pilot project. Overall, there was limited feedback from the public and no increase in bylaw or RCMP enforcement or calls. For ease of administration and enforcement, staff recommend this program be extended to all City parks as a year-round and permanent program. The new proposed bylaw would come into effect in late June 2024 and would restrict alcohol consumption on amenities in parks such as playgrounds, spray parks and artificial turf fields.\nSubject: Responsible Consumption of Alcohol in Burnaby Parks - Pilot Review and Ongoing Program\nOpen Council Meeting April 15, 2024 ........................................... Page 2\n1.0 POLICY SECTION\nA program to allow for alcohol consumption in select City parks is authorized under the British Columbia Liquor Control and Licensing Act (s. 73) and related regulation (s. 197, Liquor Control and Licensing Regulation) (\"Act and Regulation\"), which authorizes the City to designate a public place, or part of a public place, over which the City has jurisdiction as a place where liquor may be consumed by the public. The Act and Regulation require the public place or places to be designated by bylaw and the bylaw to include certain conditions and requirements.\n2.0 BACKGROUND\nAt the May 8, 2023, Regular Council meeting, staff were directed by Council to develop a pilot program to allow for the consumption of alcohol in outdoor areas in select Burnaby parks for the 2023 summer season. As part of that review, staff identified and recommended a pilot program to allow for the responsible consumption of alcohol in Confederation Park, Central Park, Keswick Park and Edmonds Park from June 23, 2023 to October 30, 2023.\nAt the June 5, 2023, Regular Council Meeting, staff presented a draft Bylaw, which was ultimately adopted by Council. As part of the pilot program, staff were also directed to work with the Parks, Recreation and Culture Commission (now Parks, Recreation and Culture Committee (PRCC)) on evaluating the pilot upon its completion. At the July 11, 2023, Commission Meeting, an evaluation framework was presented and more recently, at the February 13, 2024, PRCC meeting, staff presented the evaluation and sought feedback regarding the analysis and potential future options for the program.\nStaff are now presenting the pilot program evaluation and recommendation regarding a permanent and expanded program for Council's consideration as detailed below.\n3.0 GENERAL INFORMATION\nAs established through the Responsible Consumption of Alcohol in Parks Bylaw 2023, Bylaw 14571, the pilot program occurred from June 23 – October 30, 2023, and included one park in each city quadrant - Confederation Park, Keswick Park, Central Park and Edmonds Park. The choice of these parks considered the size and layout and amenities such as washrooms, safety and proximity to transit. The program allowed alcohol consumption throughout the park with restrictions of a 10-metre radius around programmed amenities such as playgrounds, spray parks and sport courts, etc. As required by legislation, each park included signage which outlined basic information regarding the program and a QR code to the City's website which hosted more information and a link to a public survey.\n3.1 Community Feedback and Program Monitoring\nThroughout the duration of the pilot program, an online survey was hosted on the City's website. A summary of the survey results is attached to this report as Attachment 2. In total, 45 responses were received. The respondents were all Burnaby residents. The majority of open-ended feedback received centered around the confusion regarding the restriction of consumption within 10 metres of programmed areas, which many found confusing or difficult to abide by.\nSubject: Responsible Consumption of Alcohol in Burnaby Parks - Pilot Review and Ongoing Program\nOpen Council Meeting April 15, 2024 ........................................... Page 3\nIn addition to a public survey, staff also monitored for any increase in calls or complaints regarding alcohol consumption in each of the pilot parks. During the pilot project, there was no notable increase in call volume or complaints at the facilities, to Bylaw or the RCMP. Only 2 calls in total were received by customer service staff related to questions about the program only. Staff also monitored for an increase in garbage and waste in each park and no significant increase was noted.\nThe general lack of response, combined with the lack of complaints or issues identified by staff is consistent with the experience many other municipalities have noted during similar pilot programs and leads staff to believe that the responsible consumption of alcohol in City parks is not a significant issue. In general, park goers followed the restrictions and acted responsibly in alignment with the intent of this program.\nStaff also met with other interested parties including Fraser Health, who had previously indicated concerns regarding the pilot program and stated their continued concerns with expanding the program.\n3.2 PRC Committee Feedback\nStaff presented the pilot program results and 3 of the options included in this report for the Committee's feedback recently. The feedback revolved around several main themes including: the need to keep the program simple for the public to understand and for the City to enforce; making the program more accessible across the City and at local parks within walking distance; and the importance of recognizing the role of local parks as safe third spaces and backyards for those living in higher density spaces. While there was general support for expanding the program to all City parks, not all members agreed and some concerns were raised regarding additional waste in parks, the lack of washroom facilities, public drinking in parks adjacent to schools and amenities where children are at play and the lack of public response. There was also some discussion regarding the general recognition that some park goers are likely drinking in parks already in the absence of a bylaw and whether there is a need to create a program at all. In addition, comments were made that allowing responsible consumption of alcohol is not the same as allowing public drunkenness.\n3.3 Municipal Comparison\nStaff also conducted a review of similar programs across Metro Vancouver municipalities. Similar to Burnaby's pilot, the most consistent and notable community feedback amongst municipalities that surveyed was the request from the public for simplicity when it comes to ensuring that they are able to comply with the bylaw. Many municipalities have either piloted or made permanent the ability to consume alcohol responsibly in a number of their parks, with several continually expanding their program to more and more parks in recent years. Most municipalities have made responsible consumption permanent, while a couple of municipalities are still in the pilot phase. One Lower Mainland municipality, the City of Richmond, has discontinued their pilot program based on a large amount of feedback in opposition to the program from their residents.\nSubject: Responsible Consumption of Alcohol in Burnaby Parks - Pilot Review and Ongoing Program\nOpen Council Meeting April 15, 2024 ........................................... Page 4\n3.4 Pilot Summary\nOverall, staff consider the pilot program to largely be a success. The lack of complaints and issues has been the typical experience with these programs across the municipalities that currently allow responsible alcohol consumption in parks. In fact, staff have fielded several phone calls in recent weeks from residents inquiring about the status of the program and what parks allow the consumption of alcohol currently.\nAs noted by staff in previous reports, parks are highly valued outdoor spaces that support recreation and community connectedness. They are becoming even more valuable as more residents live in higher density communities where access to outdoor spaces is limited. Allowing the responsible consumption of alcohol in parks can enhance many residents' enjoyment of parks and based on the experience through the pilot program, residents and park goers have demonstrated this can be achieved responsibly without impacting other park goers.\n3.5 Proposed Options\nBased on an analysis of the pilot program, staff have examined four options for Council's consideration. Options 2 through 4 were presented to the PRC Committee and Option 1 was added for Council's consideration based on their input:\n1. Discontinue the program: staff recognize, as noted by the PRC Committee, that some park goers are likely to drink in parks with or without an established program or bylaw. The City has an option to not establish a program at all, however, staff do not recommend this as a program helps to establish expectations and guidelines for park users around responsible consumption of alcohol;\n2. Make the pilot program sites permanent: this option would establish the program not only to run as a pilot in 2023 in the same four parks, but year-round;\n3. Expand the pilot program: this would include expanding the program to more parks, but still limiting the responsible consumption of alcohol to parks within walking distance to transit;\n4. Establish a city-wide year-round program (Recommended): this option would make Burnaby a municipal leader in allowing the responsible consumption of alcohol across all City parks. This option is easier for the public to understand, and for staff to administer as well as enforce. The proposed Bylaw would remove the 10-metre restrictions and make clearer the areas in parks where drinking is prohibited.\n",

In November 2023, Council approved the revised Terms of Reference for the Property Tax Policy Review to be undertaken in two phases, with Phase I to be delivered in time to inform Council's deliberation on the 2024 tax distribution.\n\nThe purpose of this report is to present the work undertaken by Ernst & Young LLP (\"EY\") on the Property Tax Policy Review – Phase I. EY examined a portfolio of non-residential and residential metrics and recent economic development, and concluded that there is no compelling evidence that warrants a tax shift between non-residential and residential property classes at this time. The City's expert advisors agree with this conclusion.\n\nCouncil Authority/Previous Decisions\nIn April 2023, Council adopted a motion to convene a new Property Tax Policy Review Commission. In November 2023, Council approved the revised Terms of Reference for the Property Tax Policy Review to be undertaken in two phases.\n\nCity Manager's Comments\nThe City Manager concurs with the foregoing recommendations.\n\nContext and Background\nOver the last 15 years, Council engaged the Property Tax Policy Review Commission multiple times to address issues concerning the impact of the City's taxation policies on Vancouver's economy, including tax stability & predictability and tax distribution.\n\nDiscussion\nIn December 2023, EY was selected to lead the Phase I review, encompassing metrics for business and residents, and tax share.\n\nMetrics – Business & Residents\nEY considered the metrics recommended by the Commission and identified additional non-residential and new residential metrics.\n\nStakeholder Engagement\nEY conducted targeted stakeholder engagement with representatives from GVBOT, BOMA, CFIB, and Vancouver BIAs in February and March of 2024.\n",

The Board may require sufficient capacity to fulfill its governance responsibilities, but the proposed increase represents a small proportion of the VPD's approved operating budget.\n\nContext and Background:\nThe Police Act governs the budget process for the VPD, which differs from other City departments. The Board submits a provisional budget to the City by November 30th, and may revise it before March 1st.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe revised VPD provisional budget includes $690,000 for Board administration and operations, a $393,000 increase from the amount approved by Council in December 2023.\n\nFinancial Implications:\nThe $393,000 increase was not included in the approved 7.5% property tax increase. If Council adopts Option B, the incremental funding could be managed as a one-time 2024 expense.\n\nLegal Implications:\nIf Council adopts Option B and the Board contests the decision, the matter could be referred to the Director of Police Services for a binding determination.\n",

THAT Council approve, in principle, amendments to the City Land Regulation By-law No. 8735 to designate certain public places over which the City has jurisdiction as places where liquor may be consumed.\nB. THAT the Director of Legal Services be instructed to bring forward for enactment by Council a By-law to amend the City Land Regulation By-law to designate these places, generally as set out in Appendix A.\n\nPurpose and Executive Summary:\nThis report outlines seven plaza locations recommended for the 2024 Alcohol Consumption in Public Plazas Program. Based on requests from community partner stewards, the program will operate on a year-round or seasonal basis at different locations. This report also recommends an extension to allow alcohol consumption at the Drinker's Lounge parklet, which supports a community-based managed alcohol and harm reduction program operated by PHS Community Services Society.\n\nPrevious Council Decisions:\nSee Appendix B for a full list of Council decisions.\n\n2023: Council approved amendments to the City Land Regulation By-law No. 8735 to allow liquor consumption in one public plaza from May 15 to October 16, 2023, and in six public plazas year-round, and instructed staff to bring the by-law forward for enactment.\n2022: Council approved the Alcohol Consumption in Public Plazas Policy and amendments to the City Land Regulation By-law No. 8735 to extend the Drinker's Lounge permitted alcohol consumption at 111 Princess to March 31, 2024. Additionally, Council approved amendments to the By-law to allow liquor consumption in six public plazas from June 15 to October 10, 2022.\n2021: Council approved amendments to the City Land Regulation By-law No. 8735 to allow a pilot for liquor consumption at a proposed parklet at 111 Princess (\"Drinker's Lounge\") from March 1 to July 31, 2021, and instructed staff to bring the by-law forward for enactment. Further amendments extended the pilot at Drinker's Lounge until March 31, 2022. Additionally, Council approved amendments to the By-law to allow a pilot for liquor consumption in three public plazas from July 15 to October 11, 2021.\n2020: Council directed staff to prepare a by-law pursuant to Section 73 subsections (2), (3) and (4) of the Liquor Control and Licensing Act, to allow a pilot for liquor consumption in select public places under the jurisdiction of the City. After consultation with VPD, VCH, internal stakeholders, and local Business Improvement Associations, four public plazas were selected for inclusion in the pilot program.\n\nCity Manager's Comments:\nThe City Manager concurs with the foregoing recommendations.\n\nContext and Background:\nDirected by Council, staff piloted the Alcohol Consumption in Public Plazas Program to enable seasonal public alcohol consumption in public plazas in 2020 and 2021. In 2022 Council adopted the Alcohol Consumption in Public Plazas Policy based on positive public space monitoring, strong public support for the program (92% in a 2021 survey), reported benefits to community partners, and an absence of any health or safety issues observed or raised by stakeholders (VPD and VCH) in previous years. The Policy outlines a framework for the Alcohol Consumption in Public Plazas Program to operate, and the 2024 program follows this Policy's recommendations.\n\nThrough partnership with the Drinker's Lounge, a community managed alcohol program operated by PHS Community Services Society, the parklet at 111 Princess Street has been in operation since March 2021. Enabling alcohol consumption at this site provides a safe and dignified outdoor space for program participants. The parklet has not had any complaints or issues raised from surrounding businesses or the VPD in previous years.\n\nProposed 2024 Locations:\nIn early 2024, staff requested proposals from our plaza partners via an 'Expression of Interest' process. We received requests for seven sites, and we have reviewed them based on the criteria established in the Alcohol Consumption in Public Plazas Policy.\n\nThe ability to secure public access to washrooms was again a critical criterion of site viability. All proposed sites will have signage directing visitors to a nearby park bathroom, a publicly accessible business washroom, or to a portable washroom in the plaza or nearby managed by a community steward partner. Washroom service hours similarly determine which hours residents can consume alcohol in the proposed plazas, with permissible hours adjusted to the seasonal hours of nearby park bathrooms, business hours, and hours when community steward partners are able to lock and unlock portable washrooms.\n\nStaff recommend continuing to offer two program streams for plazas; one for seasonal participation and one for year round. There were no issues with this approach last year, and staff have no concerns with continuing this approach as long as it is done in accordance with the Alcohol Consumption in Public Plazas Policy, i.e. staff monitor public space, bathroom access is maintained, and community steward partners are able to co-manage.\n\nAdding the need to extend PHS's Drinker's Lounge parklet to the expressed plazas needs, staff propose:\n\nRecommended Sites:\nSocial Service Parklet - 3-Year extension (May 15, 2024 to May 15, 2027):\n• PHS Drinker's Lounge Parklet – returning site\nLocation: 111 Princess St.\nPartners: PHS Community Services Society, Vancouver Coastal Health – returning partners\n\nPublic Plazas - Year round (May 15, 2024 to May 14, 2025):\n• Main & 21st Neighbourhood Plaza – returning site\nLocation: West block of E 21st Ave. at Main St.\nPartners: Coco et Olive café, Little Mountain Neighbourhood House, residents – returning partners\nWashroom access: Prince Edward Park Public Washroom (400 metres away)\n• Cambie & 17th Neighbourhood Plaza – returning site\nLocation: East block of W 17th Ave. at Cambie St.\nPartner: Cambie Village Business Association (CVBA) – returning partner\nWashroom access: on-site temporary portable washroom\n• Cambie & 18th Neighbourhood Plaza – returning site\nLocation: West block of W 18th Ave. at Cambie St.\nPartner: Cambie Village Business Association (CVBA) – returning partner\nWashroom access: via on-site temporary portable washroom at Cambie & 17th Plaza (370 metres away)\n• Granville & 13th Neighbourhood Plaza – returning site\nLocation: West block of W 13th Ave. at Granville St.\nPartner: South Granville Business Improvement Association (SGBIA) – returning partner\nWashroom access: Granville Park Public Washroom (350 metres away)\n• Granville & 14th Neighbourhood Plaza – returning site\nLocation: East block of W 14th Ave. at Granville St.\nPartner: South Granville Business Improvement Association (SGBIA) – returning partner\nWashroom access: Granville Park Public Washroom (260 metres away)\n• Lot 19 – returning site\nLocation: 855 W Hastings St.\nPartner: Downtown Vancouver Business Improvement Association (DVBIA) – returning partner\nWashroom access: public washrooms in nearby food courts\n\nPublic Plazas - Seasonal (May 15 to October 16, 2024):\n• Maple & 4th Neighbourhood Plaza – returning site\nLocation: South block of Maple St. at W 4th Ave.\nPartner: Kitsilano West 4th Avenue Business Improvement Association – returning partner\nWashroom access: on-site temporary portable washroom\n\nSee the draft by-law in Appendix A for maps of locations and designated areas at each location. The program's hours mirror the operating hours of the nearby washrooms, so they vary for year round plazas. From May 15 to October 16, 2024, the program is proposed to run from 11am to 9pm daily, and from October 17, 2024 to May 14, 2025 the program is proposed to run from 11am to 5pm daily. The program at the Drinker's Lounge parklet is proposed to continue operating from 9:30 am to 4:30 pm daily.\n\nDiscussion:\nStaff have no concerns regarding the suitability of any of the proposed sites for alcohol consumption. The community partners at all sites are experienced at managing public alcohol consumption and are capable and willing to do so again in 2024. Staff will continue to work closely with the partners to ensure sites remain safe, welcoming, and well maintained.\n\nSimilar to previous years, City signage in each plaza will clearly indicate public alcohol consumption hours, direct visitors to the nearest bathroom, and invite residents to provide feedback to staff via 311 and email via plazas@vancouver.ca.\n\nFinancial Implications:\nCity costs for implementation of needed infrastructure such as portable washrooms, program signage, and other site-specific needs will be managed within existing Engineering budgets. The 2024 program is estimated to cost up to approximately $10,000 for the duration of the program. These costs do not include staff time.\n\nLegal Implications:\nSection 73 of the Liquor Control and Licensing Act (BC) gives the City the authority to designate, by by-law, public places as places where liquor may be consumed, subject to certain requirements as set out in the Act and the Liquor Control and Licensing Regulation.\n",

The current application is to rezone 6851 and 6871 Elmbridge Way from Industrial Business Park (IB1) to High-Density Mixed Use (ZMU52) – Oval Village (City Centre) to permit a high density mixed-use project.\n\nThe April 15, 2024 deadline is because the subject rezoning was considered as an in-stream proposal with respect to affordable housing requirements in place prior to the approval of the amendments to the Low End Market Rental (LEMR) program on November 15, 2021. When these policy changes were approved, City Council adopted provisions for enabling in-stream rezoning applications to proceed in accordance with the LEMR policy in place prior to November 15, 2021.\n\nThe rezoning for 6851 and 6871 Elmbridge Way was granted 1st reading on November 14, 2022. At the December 19, 2022 Public Hearing, the rezoning was referred back to staff and the developer to address traffic and lane comments. A report responding to these matters and presenting revisions to the development was endorsed by Council on April 24,2023 and forwarded to the Public Hearing on May 15, 2023 where 3rd reading of the rezoning amendment bylaw was granted.\n\nThe applicant's submitted written request for rezoning adoption extension to June 10, 2024 is provided in Attachment 2 and is based on requesting an extension to in-stream protection for affordable LEMR program requirements applicable to this project. The requested extension date by the applicant complies with current in-stream protection related to the market rental housing policy change that ends on June 20, 2024.\n\nFindings of Fact\nThe subject development is a high-density mixed use project located in the City Centre Area Plan (CCAP) – Oval Village Sub Area that consists of commercial floor area, a hotel, residential floor area, and infrastructure works.\n\nAnalysis\nSince 3rd reading of Bylaw 10423 was granted on May 15, 2023, the submission, review and approval of a road functional plan, and the preparation of the various legal agreements identified in the rezoning considerations have been initiated and are ongoing.\n",

The amendment would allow for a six-storey, mixed-use rental building of which 20% of the residential floor area is secured as below-market rental units, in accordance with the Secured Rental Policy (SRP). An estimated total of 74 secured rental units may be delivered through this application. A future building design would be submitted through the development permit process and reviewed with the public at that time. Staff have assessed the application and conclude that it meets the intent of the SRP. Staff recommend that the application be referred to a Public Hearing, with the recommendation of the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability to approve it in principle, subject to the Public Hearing, and conditions contained within Appendix B.\n\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\n• Vancouver Plan (2022)\n• Secured Rental Policy (2012, last amended 2023)\n• RR-3A and RR-3B Districts Schedule (2023)\n• Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines (2023)\n• Comprehensive Development (CD-1) District Schedule (26) (1963)\n• Housing Vancouver Strategy (2017)\n• Housing Needs Report (2022)\n• Family Room: Housing Mix Policy for Rezoning Projects (2016)\n• High-Density Housing for Families with Children Guidelines (1992, last amended 2022)\n• Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (2010, last amended 2023)\n• Urban Forest Strategy (2014, amended 2018)\n• Vancouver Development Cost Levy By-law No. 9755\n• Vancouver Utilities Development Cost Levy By-law No. 12183\n• Provincial Bill 47- Housing Statues (Transit Oriented Areas) Amendment Act, adopted November 30, 2023\n\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site is located mid block, comprised of one legal parcel fronting Arbutus Street and north of West 32nd Avenue (see Figure 1). The site and the entire block is zoned CD-1 (26) and bounded by Valley Drive, West 32nd Avenue, Yew and Arbutus Streets. The existing CD-1 zone is addressed as 4615-4699 Arbutus Street, 4620-4676 Yew Street, and 2105 West 32nd Avenue and consists of four legal parcels with four separate owners. The current proposal is limited to redevelopment of the central portion of the CD-1 (26) site, addressed as 4635 Arbutus Street.\n\nThe site area is approximately 1,762 sq. m (18,966 sq. ft.) with a frontage of 41.3 m (135.5 ft.) along Arbutus Street and a depth of 42.7 m (140 ft.). The CD-1 (26) permits a mix of uses, including commercial, service, and residential. The current uses on the rezoning site, 4635 Arbutus Street, are a two-storey commercial building constructed in 1965 and a surface parking lot. The property does not contain residential rental tenancies and the Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy (TRPP) does not apply. The surrounding sites are zoned R1-1 (Residential Inclusive) and CD-1 which permit a mix of uses, including commercial, service, and residential uses. The Prince of Wales Park and Secondary School are also located to the west of the site.\n\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan - The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan serves as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\n\nSecured Rental Policy (SRP) - The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These updates included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations.\n\nThe SRP outlines the following locational eligibility criteria for sites in low-density areas: In an existing R1-1 or RT zone, outside of recent community plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings); Located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping; and On the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road. Sites that meet these criteria and that are part of the typical street grid (containing a lane or secondary street access to the rear) and are regular in shape, size and other attributes may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the residential rental zones.\n\nThe SRP also supports consideration for existing CD-1 sites to be rezoned to Residential Rental (RR) zones. Rezoning applications for existing CD-1 sites may be considered if existing residential rental units do not currently exist and where infill development does not displace existing residential tenants. The proposed Residential Rental (RR) zone must also be appropriate to the location and context. Further, the proposal must generally meet the locational eligibility criteria set out within the SRP.\n\nThe SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six-storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under the SRP for six-storey buildings.\n\nRR Zoning District Schedules and Design Guidelines - Along with updates to the SRP, in December, 2021 Council approved the addition of new residential rental (\"RR\") zoning district schedules to the Zoning and Development By-law: \"RR-1\", \"RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C\", and \"RR-3A and RR-3B\". Like other standard zoning districts, the RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, for which stratification or sale of individual residential units are not permitted.\n\nFurther direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines. Recognizing that the SRP and RR zones are intended to enable incremental change in neighbourhoods that currently consist primarily of detached houses and duplexes, the guidelines support new missing middle housing forms that are compatible with the existing context.\n",

The appearance of the signs were later updated to their current BCAA design as part of PPA #02-00321.\n2.3 Skysigns are defined in the Burnaby Skysign Guidelines for Commercial Buildings as signs located at the top of major commercial buildings (offices and hotels), at or above the third-floor level. These Guidelines have been prepared to assist in the evaluation of skysign rezoning applications and establish regulations for skysign height, size, and density, to name a few.\n2.4 The applicant has now submitted a plan of development suitable for First and Second Reading of the Rezoning Bylaw.\n3.0 GENERAL INFORMATION\n3.1 The proposed skysigns would be affixed to the top storey of the north and south elevations of an existing building and would be visible from Canada Way to the south and Willingdon Green to the North. The proposed skysigns are compatible with the neighbourhood character, as the subject site is surrounded by a business park, light industrial land uses across Canada Way to the southeast, and BCIT to the south. There is no anticipated impact to residential neighbourhoods. The removal of the two existing skysigns which are located on the east and west elevations would be required before the proposed skysigns could be installed.\n3.2 The proposed lettered skysigns with logos are 4.06 metres wide (13.33 feet), 2.26 metres tall (7.42 feet), and 0.15 metres deep (0.5 feet), with an area of 9.14 square metres (98.42 square feet) each. The height of the BCAA letters of each sign would be 1.12 metres (3.67 feet). These specifications are in line with the City's Skysign Guidelines for commercial buildings.\n",

The subject property is currently occupied by two single-family dwellings, an active farm operation, and associated farm buildings and seasonal farm labour accommodation.\n\nBackground\nAs part of the subject farm operation's participation in the Federal Government's Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program (SAWP), Richmond Fire-Rescue (RFR) inspected the seasonal farm labour accommodation on the subject site in 2022. The existing seasonal farm labour accommodation on-site required applicable Agricultural Land Commission (ALC) and City approvals, including an ALR NARU application and rezoning application. The subject site is currently zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\", which does not permit seasonal farm labour accommodation. The purpose of the ALC NARU application and the rezoning to the \"Agriculture (AG3)\" zone is to allow the existing seasonal farm labour accommodation on-site.\n\nFindings of Fact\nA Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 2).\n\nSurrounding Development\nTo the North: Property zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\" and located in the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) associated with the subject farm operation.\nTo the South: Across Westminster Highway, properties zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\" and located in the ALR.\nTo the East: A religious assembly building on a property split-zoned \"Assembly (ASY)\" and \"Agriculture (AG1)\".\nTo the West: Property zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\" and located in the ALR.\n\nRelated Policies & Studies\nOfficial Community Plan/Farming First Strategy\nThe subject site is designated \"Agriculture (AGR)\" in the Official Community Plan (OCP), which includes those areas where the principal use is agriculture and food production, but may include other land uses as permitted under the Agricultural Land Commission Act (ALCA). The proposal is consistent with this designation.\nThe OCP and Farming First Strategy also include policy indicating that seasonal farm labour accommodation, as an additional residential use, may be considered so long as the accommodation is accessory to the principal agricultural purposes and helps to support a farm operation in the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR). The proposal is consistent with this policy.\n\nMinistry of Transportation and Infrastructure\nAs the subject site is located within 800 m of an intersection of a Provincial Limited Access Highway and a City road, this proposal was referred to the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MOTI). Confirmation has been received from MOTI indicating no objection to the proposal. Final approval from MOTI is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\n\nFloodplain Management Implementation Strategy\nThe proposal must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\n\nHeritage\nThe building containing the seasonal farm labour accommodation is listed on the City's Heritage Inventory (Beckwith Barn). The Beckwith Barn is proposed to remain, with minor interior and exterior changes required to accommodate BC Building Code requirements (no Heritage Alteration Permit (HAP) required). The property owner has agreed to register a legal agreement on Title prohibiting demolition or exterior changes to the \"Beckwith Barn\" building without consent from the City to ensure heritage character defining elements are maintained.\nA second building (Beckwith House) which is located on the property, is also listed on the City's Heritage Inventory. This second building is not associated with the proposed seasonal farm labour use, and there are no proposed changes to that building.\n\nFood Security & Agricultural Advisory Committee\nThe proposal was reviewed and supported by the Food Security and Agricultural Advisory Committee (FSAAC) at its meeting held on September 28, 2023.\n\nPublic Consultation\nIn accordance with the City's Early Public Notification Policy, notice of the rezoning application was provided to residents within 100 metres of the subject site. In addition, a rezoning sign has been posted on the subject property.\n",

The applicant has revised the proposal to include 10 three-bedroom units, as outlined in Table 2.\n\nCommunity Amenity:\nThe rezoning application provides the opportunity to secure up to 577.7 m2 (6,218.31 ft2) of City-owned amenity space, to be constructed in a subsequent phase as part of a larger City-owned facility on the site. Legal agreements ensure the City may secure up to 4,975 m2 (53,550 ft2) of amenity space at Council's discretion.\n\nChildcare:\nA physical childcare facility is not required in the current development phase.

The applicant will adjust the market rental unit mix to include 10 three-bedroom units.\n2. Legal agreements secure the applicant's commitment to construct 577.7 m2 (6,218.31 ft2) of City-owned amenity space in a subsequent phase.\n3.

Site and Context\nThe subject site is located in Kensington-Cedar Cottage, at the southeast corner of East 12th Avenue and Clark Drive (Figure 1). The area is incorporated in the Grandview-Woodland Community Plan as part of the \"Commercial-Broadway Station Area Precinct\". The property has a site area of 1,056 sq. m (11,373 sq. ft.) with a frontage of 28.4 m (93 ft.) along East 12th Avenue and a depth of 35 m (115 ft.). The current zoning is RM-11N and while the property is a vacant lot today, it formerly contained commercial uses. Properties at this intersection include two gas stations and a small commercial node. The surrounding context is residential (detached/duplex housing), with new mid-rise residential projects under construction nearby.\n\nNeighbourhood Amenities - The following amenities are within close proximity: Parks: Cedar Cottage Park (200 m), China Creek South Park (210 m), Clark Park (350 m) Institutional: Queen Alexandra Elementary School (260 m), Vancouver Community College (550 m), Tyee Elementary School (850 m), Charles Dickens Elementary School (900 m) Other Community Facilities: Mount Pleasant Neighbourhood House (1 km), Kensington Branch Public Library (1.2 km), Trout Lake Community Centre and ice rink (1.3 km) Transportation: Commercial-Broadway Station (800 m)\n\nLocal School Capacity - The site is within the catchment area of Queen Alexandra Elementary and Vancouver Technical Secondary School. According to the Vancouver School Board (VSB)'s 2020 Long Range Facilities Plan, both Queen Alexandra Elementary and Vancouver Technical Secondary School will be operating below capacity by 2031, with a utilization rate of 43% and 78%, respectively. The VSB report notes that overall enrollment trends for the wider area are changing. The VSB continues to explore options to reduce pressure on schools in this area, monitor development, and work with City staff to help plan for future growth.\n\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan - The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The plan serves as a framework, with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. Central to the Vancouver Plan are relevant \"Big Ideas\" related to (1) Equitable Housing and Complete Neighbourhoods, and (2) An Economy that Works for All. The site is located within the Grandview-Woodland Community Plan boundaries, which is generally in alignment with the Vancouver Plan.\n\nGrandview-Woodland Community Plan - The site is within the Station Residential area in the Commercial Broadway Station Precinct of the Plan (see Figure 2). This area is expected to evolve to accommodate new low- and mid-rise apartment building forms in a compact\n",

    "text": "February 27, 2024\nNotice of Motion for Community Safety Meeting agenda March 12\nMotion:\nThat staff research and review current policies and bylaws relating to body rub studios by consulting with agencies such as SWAN, PACE Society, Living in Community, Pivot Legal Society, and VCASE, as well as compare to bylaws in other municipalities; that staff report back to Community Safety Committee with findings and options to ensure policies are aligned with current best practices.\n\nBackground:\nOn February 26, Richmond City Council voted for an option for enforcement of escort services and body rub studios and subsequent amendments to the related bylaws which would allow for increased inspections and escalated fines for business license holders not in compliance.\n\nWe have received correspondence from the agencies listed in the referral motion, as well as other experts and authors of peer-reviewed publications, and some groups offering another viewpoint such as VCASE. Many have offered to meet and consult with Richmond staff.\n\nDelegations repeatedly stated that increased enforcement was causing harm to women, as some have chosen to leave the safe place of work in Richmond and go underground. Of interest is the suggestion that other municipalities have slightly less stringent bylaws around employee registration that offer more discretion.\n\nWe heard that all women known to those who have studied the subject who work in body rub studios have chosen this work without coercion, and they may be professionals in the community but unable to make financial ends meet. Having to register as an employee of a body rub studio at City Hall is not discreet enough for some.\n\nWe also heard that there have been no cases of human trafficking in approximately 20 years. If human trafficking is extremely rare in these establishments, then we should be equally concerned with the very real possibility that our bylaws could be making it less safe for women.\n\nBy researching and reviewing the bylaws and consulting with experts from all sides, we should be able to strike a balance that ensures protection and safety of employees, compliance with bylaws, a relationship of trust between employees and the city and RCMP, and prevention of human trafficking and organized crime.\n",

In 2023, the City and partners continued progress on the strategy's 32 actions.\n\nHighlights include:\n- Extension of Alderbridge Supportive Housing's ground lease to prevent tenant displacement.\n- Approval to rezone City lands for a new 25-unit affordable housing building for women and women with children.\n- Increased resources approved in the 2024 budget to expand homelessness response capacity.\n- Continued implementation of initiatives using UBCM grant funding, including expanded Warming Centres and Drop-in Centre services.\n- Increased permanent and extreme weather beds at the Richmond House Emergency Shelter.\n",

That staff advise the Province that the City of Richmond consents to the Electric Kick Scooter Pilot Project taking place within the City, effective April 5, 2024.\n\nOrigin:\n- In July 2021, Council endorsed bylaw amendments to enable participation in the three-year Provincial E-Scooter Pilot Project.\n- The provincial government is extending the e-scooter project for another four-year period, effective April 5, 2024.\n- Staff recommend the City's continued participation in the Provincial E-Scooter Pilot Project.\n\nAnalysis:\n- The City's E-Scooter Pilot Project began in July 2021, allowing the public to legally ride e-scooters on streets with cycling facilities and shared pathways.\n- The City was the first municipality in Metro Vancouver to offer a public shared e-scooter service, with Lime launching in May 2022.\n- Over 107,000 e-scooter trips and 13,000 e-bike rides have been taken since the shared system's deployment.\n- A public survey showed interest and support for e-scooters, with concerns about sidewalk riding and enforcement.\n- Safety and education campaigns, including collaboration with RCMP and Lime, are an integral part of the pilot project.\n- E-scooter collision data is not yet available, but the incident rate for Lime devices is 0.02%.\n- The RCMP have issued tickets for lack of helmet use and excessive speeds, but have focused on education.\n\nFinancial Impact: None.\n\nConclusion:\nThe E-Scooter Pilot Project has provided a popular travel option, with over 107,000 public shared e-scooter trips. The City recommends continuing participation in the provincial pilot to manage the use of these devices.\n",

Vancouver has factors that position it to be a global leader in intra-city active transportation.\n2. Active transportation includes walking, biking, and low-power personal mobility devices.\n3. Active transportation provides mobility choice and equity, and can support lower absenteeism.\n4. Transportation 2040 set goals to ensure two-thirds of trips are by active transportation/transit and zero traffic-related fatalities.\n5. Evidence suggests safety and perceptions of safety are determinants of increasing active transportation mode share.\n6. Lower speed limits are more compatible with active transportation and healthier, equitable communities.\n7. In 2019, Council approved a resolution for a 30 km/h residential street pilot and a UBCM resolution requesting an MVA amendment.\n8. The MVA was amended in 2019 to allow speed reduction Pilot Projects, and the MoTI clarified signage requirements.\n9. The City introduced Slow Streets and Neighbourhood Traffic Management Programs in response to COVID-19.\n10. 72% of Vancouverites think a 30 km/h speed reduction on select residential streets is a good or very good idea.\n11. The City's 2023-2026 Strategic Priority and election commitments align with safer, slower streets.\n12. Recent Council-approved expansion of electric kick scooter use will increase active transportation road users.\n13. The International Transport Forum recommends speed limits of no higher than 30 km/h where motorized vehicles and vulnerable road users share the same space.\n14. There is an imperative to support safe, sustainable, resilient and inclusive active transportation through reduced speed limits.\n\nTHEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED\nA. Direct staff to report on benefits of 30 km/h speed limits in residential areas.\nB. Direct staff to provide clarity on MVA speed limit sign requirements and report on phasing options for city-wide or neighbourhood implementation, and funding options.\nC. Direct staff to bring forward a strategy to reduce motor vehicle traffic on designated Local Street Bikeways through physical, traffic, and placemaking interventions.\n",

    "text": "1. Vancouver has seen a rapid increase in unlicensed and unregulated retail shops selling \"magic\" mushrooms (psilocybin) and other entheogens, with no prosecution or business license regulations for their sale or display.\n\n2. Entheogens are psychoactive substances that alter perception, mood, or behavior for spiritual, therapeutic, and/or inspirational purposes, and have been used by indigenous peoples for millennia.\n\n3. Entheogenic substances are generally considered safer than opioids, with much scientific and medical research on their therapeutic use for various conditions.\n\n4. Vancouverites are consuming entheogens, with recreational use of natural psychedelics doubling in the last three years, particularly among adults aged 19-30.\n\n5. Many entheogens are designated under Schedule 3 of Canada's Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, which prohibits possession except as authorized through exemptions, including for therapeutic use.\n\n6. Despite the CDSA, mushroom dispensaries have popped up across Canada and online, selling psilocybin and entheogenic products, with no charges or convictions in Vancouver.\n\n7. The City of Vancouver has the authority to regulate land use and businesses, and previously introduced the Medical Marijuana Related Uses (MMRU) framework to ensure availability and appropriate business conduct.\n\n8. The City has a limited but essential role in responding to the overdose crisis, including creating supportive built environments and partnering on drug policy reform.\n\n9. The City could consider creating conditions and a framework to manage and promote public safety, best practices, appropriate operations, and land use for entheogen retailers, or enforce against unlicensed and unregulated retailers.\n\n10. The City is committed to public safety and harm reduction, and recognizes that a regulated market of safe supply mushrooms and entheogens can be considered a form of harm reduction.\n\n11. The City directs staff to examine the legal context and a retail framework to regulate business licenses for retailers of entheogens, based on the MMRU framework, to achieve a balance between availability and community health, safety, security, aesthetics, equity, and enjoyment of property.\n",

It also provides an overview of Phase 2 of the Master Plan, including capital investment details.\n\nCouncil Authority/Previous Decisions:\n- The Vancouver Charter gives Council powers over cemeteries.\n- In 1998, Council authorized a master plan to guide cemetery development.\n- In 2000, Council adopted the Mountain View Cemetery Master Plan.\n- In 2003, the Mountain View Cemetery By-law was enacted.\n- In 2004 and 2006, Council approved funding and operating contributions for Phase 1 implementation.\n\nContext and Background:\nMountain View Cemetery has been owned and operated by the City of Vancouver since 1887. It is the only cemetery in Vancouver and is governed by the Cremation, Interment and Funeral Services Act.\n\nThe cemetery has gone through periods of establishment, renovation, closure, and reopening. Phase 1 of the Master Plan was completed in 2008, creating new niche spaces and buildings.

The City must ensure an efficient, modern regulatory framework to foster innovation, entrepreneurship, and a conducive business environment. Fostering economic activity, growth, and innovation, as well as creating conditions to support jobs and a diverse range of commercial activities, are fundamental to a city. Council is alerted to obscure, outdated, and/or unnecessary rules and regulations that hinder economic growth and frustrate commercial activity. It is incumbent upon Council to address policies, rules, and/or regulations that needlessly hinder innovation, entrepreneurship, and legitimate commercial activity. By rectifying known impediments to Vancouver's economic competitiveness and the city's ability to attract investment and create local job opportunities, Council demonstrates a commitment to promoting a dynamic and thriving business economy.\nTHEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to review the specific business license situations referenced, report back with any recommended by-law and zoning amendments and/or associated implications, and conduct this work in collaboration with relevant industries, local businesses affected, and other stakeholders to ensure the City's rules and regulations are relevant, meaningful, and demonstrate the City's adaptability to the ever-evolving economic and business landscape.\n",

Co-op housing has enabled affordable housing through government partnerships, but lacks a viable path forward for renewal and new development.\n2. Renewing aging co-op stock and delivering new co-op homes requires all levels of government and partners working together.\n3. The City of Vancouver formed the Vancouver Housing Development Office to utilize city land for middle-income housing.\n4. The City can leverage underutilized city-owned land to create more affordable and attainable homes.\n5. Ensuring a diverse range of housing is essential for Vancouver's future.\n6. The housing crisis threatens the quality of life for many residents.\n7. Rents and home prices in Vancouver are among the highest in the country.\n8. Purchasing a home in Vancouver is unattainable for most people.\n9. The City must fulfill its housing policy directions to meet the needs of the growing population.\n10. City-owned land is a significant public asset that should be optimally managed for public benefit.\n11. The City owns and manages land in Champlain Heights and False Creek South.\n12. Using public land to enable more affordable housing is vital to addressing the housing crisis.\n13. The Housing Vancouver Strategy aimed to deliver more co-op housing, but has faced challenges.\n14. The Strategy outlined actions to maintain and grow the City's non-market housing portfolio.\n15. Co-ops on city-owned land provide important benefits and represent a significant portion of the City's non-market housing.\n16. There is an opportunity to preserve and grow mixed-income communities on underutilized city-owned land.\n17. The Co-operative Housing Federation of BC (CHF BC) has been a partner with the City.\n18. CHF BC's Community Land Trust model and asset management services can address co-op challenges.\n19. Many co-op land leases are due to expire, and co-op sites have potential for new development.\n20. The City owns and manages approximately 80 acres in False Creek South.\n21. Residents surveyed agreed with a mixed-tenure, mixed-income approach for False Creek South.\n22. The Future of False Creek South report outlined opportunities to create new affordable homes.\n23. The report aims to honor the original 1970s vision for a mixed-tenure, mixed-income neighbourhood.\n24. The Province's BC Builds program will provide financing and grants for middle-class rental homes.\n25. The Federal Government has announced additional funding for the BC Builds program.\n26. The City must respond decisively to optimize city-owned land for needed housing.\n27. Co-op housing can work with fresh thinking, partnerships, and a mix of affordability levels.\n\nTHEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED:\nA. Council directs staff to report on opportunities to build new co-op housing on existing city-owned co-op sites.\nB. The report should include opportunities to partner with CHF BC and explore new co-op housing models.\nC. Council directs staff to report on an updated False Creek South Development Plan, including retaining city ownership, increasing housing targets, and options for existing residents.\n",

    "text": "COUNCIL MEMBERS' MOTION\n\n1. Stanley Park Train Accessibility\nSubmitted by: Councillor Fry\n\nWHEREAS\n1. The City of Vancouver announced the return of the Stanley Park Train, but local media reported it would not include a wheelchair-accessible car, excluding some with disabilities.\n2. The Stanley Park Train previously included a wheelchair-accessible car, making it accessible for some wheelchair users.\n3. Vancouver City Council adopted an Accessibility Strategy on July 19, 2022, committing to supporting full participation of persons with disabilities by establishing inclusive services, programs, and infrastructure, and identifying, removing, and preventing barriers.\n4. The BC Human Rights Code prohibits denying or discriminating against persons with disabilities regarding any accommodation, service, or facility customarily available to the public.\n5. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, ratified by Canada, requires ensuring the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by children with disabilities on an equal basis, and ensuring access to cultural performances, services, and sites of national cultural importance.\n6. The Vancouver City Planning Commission expressed concern with the erosion of existing accessibility and unanimously passed the Stanley Park Train Accessibility resolution.\n\nTHEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED\nA. Mayor and Council affirm that inaccessibility reflects structural and systemic ableism, and removing existing accessibility may violate the human rights of people with disabilities.\nB. Mayor and Council commit to maintaining or improving previous accessibility levels for any maintenance, construction, renovation, update, or other alteration of the City's built environment, spaces, programs, events, attractions, services, or communications.\nC. Council direct staff to amend the Accessibility Strategy to prevent any loss of existing accessibility in the City's programs, services, communications, events, environments, or spaces, and develop a policy requiring organizations receiving City funding, partnership, or endorsement to agree to the same.\nD. The Park Board be requested to consider a program compensating individuals unable to participate in the 2023 Stanley Park Train due to accessibility issues, such as free tickets for the 2024 Train.\n",

THAT Council approve, in principle, the extension of the pilot development potential relief program (\"Pilot DPRP\") in 2024 for eligible Light Industry (Class 5) and Business and Other (Class 6) properties as authorized by s. 374.6 of the Vancouver Charter; FURTHER THAT for each category of eligible properties, Council approve the percentage of assessed land value, up to a maximum of $5.4 million, to be taxed at a general purpose tax rate that is 50% lower than the blended rate for Classes 5 and 6 (to be finalized based on the 2024 Revised Assessment Roll) generally as outlined in Appendix G of this Report.\nB. THAT the Director of Legal Services, in consultation with the Director of Finance, be instructed to bring forward for enactment a by-law in accordance with Council's decision on Recommendation A.\n\nTargeted Land Assessment Averaging\nC. THAT Council approve, in principle, the continuation of the targeted 5-year land assessment averaging program in 2024 for the purpose of calculating property taxes for Residential (Class 1), Light Industry (Class 5), and Business and Other (Class 6) properties; FURTHER THAT in addition to the standard exclusions as outlined in the annual Land Assessment Averaging By-law, Council adopt a \"threshold\" of 10% above the property class average change for Class 1 and for Classes 5 and 6 (to be finalized based on the 2024 Revised Assessment Roll) to define eligibility for targeted averaging; AND FURTHER THAT applying the averaging formula will not result in: i) a year-over-year change in values falling below the Council-adopted \"threshold\" for eligible Class 1, 5 and 6 properties; and ii) a reduction in values exceeding $5.4 million for eligible Class 5 and 6 properties.\nD. THAT properties impacted by a Director of Planning-initiated amendment to the Zoning and Development By-law or an Official Development Plan be considered for targeted averaging, in accordance with the criteria set out in the annual Land Assessment Averaging By-law; FURTHER THAT properties whose owners sought additional density or a change in use from Council through rezoning, whether enacted or not, or through Council-approved policy changes, not be eligible for targeted averaging; AND FURTHER THAT subject to Recommendations A and B, properties that receive relief under the Pilot DPRP not be eligible for targeted averaging in accordance with s. 374.6(6) of the Vancouver Charter.\nE. THAT the Director of Legal Services, in consultation with the Director of Finance, be instructed to bring forward for enactment a by-law in accordance with Appendix H of this Report authorizing the use of targeted averaging in accordance with Council's decision on Recommendations C and D.\nF. THAT subject to adoption of the applicable by-law in Recommendation E, the Director of Finance be instructed to make appropriate arrangements with BC Assessment for the production of the 2024 Average Assessment Roll at an estimated cost of $25,000 plus applicable taxes; source of funding to be the 2024 Operating Budget.\n\nPurpose and Executive Summary\nThe purpose of this report is to seek Council approval to:\n• Extend the pilot development potential relief program (\"Pilot DPRP\") in 2024 as authorized by s. 374.6 of the Vancouver Charter to reduce the City's general purpose tax levy on a portion of the assessed land value of eligible Light Industry (Class 5) and Business and Other (Class 6) properties.\n• Continue to apply targeted 5-year land assessment averaging in 2024 to address assessment volatility for eligible Residential (Class 1), Light Industry (Class 5), and Business and Other (Class 6) properties.\n\nShould Council proceed with the Pilot DPRP (for Classes 5 and 6) and targeted averaging (for Classes 1, 5 and 6) in 2024, the overall impact would be ~0.2% increase to the Class 1 tax rate and ~1.8% increase to the blended Class 5/6 tax rate (to be finalized based on the 2024 Revised Assessment Roll) in order to collect the same amount of general purpose tax levies from those classes.\n\nDevelopment Potential - Bill 28 - Municipal Affairs Statutes (Property Taxation) Amendment Act, 2022 (\"Bill 28\") came into effect in November 2022. It enables municipalities to provide development potential relief to eligible Light Industry (Class 5) and Business and Other (Class 6) properties.\n\nAssessment Volatility - Since 2015, the City has used targeted averaging to provide short-term relief to \"hot\" properties, defined as properties that experience an unanticipated, year-over-year increase in total net assessed value, before land averaging is applied, which exceeds the average assessment increase for the same property class by more than ten percent.\n\nCouncil Authority/Previous Decisions\nDevelopment Potential Relief - As authorized by s. 374.6 of the Vancouver Charter, Council can, each year, consider whether or not to apply a lower general purpose tax rate on a portion of the assessed land value of eligible Light Industry (Class 5) and Business and Other (Class 6) properties.\nLand Assessment Averaging - As authorized by s. 374.4 of the Vancouver Charter, Council can, each year, consider whether or not to use land assessment averaging for calculating property taxes, and specify certain eligibility criteria based on which averaging is applied.\n\nCity Manager's Comments\nThe City Manager concurs with the foregoing recommendations.\n\nContext and Background\nStability and predictability are two desirable attributes of a property tax system. The City does not generate higher tax revenue as a result of rising property values. However, relative assessment changes for individual properties could shift the tax burden from one property to another in any given year.\n\nOver the past decade, the influx of investment capital and speculative real estate demand fuelled by an extended period of ultra-loose monetary policy has driven up land values across Metro Vancouver, resulting in significant year-over-year volatility in property assessment and taxes. Additionally, as the region continues to grow and evolve, Neighborhood Plans have been developed to set out 20 to 25-year plans to intensify land use to accommodate population growth, which has also contributed to assessment volatility.\n",

THAT Council approve in principle the summary of the 2024 Hazard Risk and Vulnerability Analysis.\nB. THAT staff report back with an updated Hazard Risk and Vulnerability Analysis that addresses new provincial requirements within the timeline specified by the updated Local Authority Emergency Management Regulation or its successor.\nC. THAT staff report back with an Emergency Management Plan considering these hazards in accordance with the timeline specified by the updated Local Authority Emergency Management Regulation or its successor.\n\nPurpose and Executive Summary:\nThe purpose of this report is to provide Council with a summary of the 2024 Hazard, Risk and Vulnerability Analysis (HRVA), its purpose, methods, results, and key findings and to seek Council endorsement of the key hazards for consideration in forthcoming plans and strategies.\n\nThis HRVA process identified thirteen hazards of greatest concern and assessed their relative risk. The highest risk hazards to Vancouver are earthquakes and extreme heat events, followed by nine medium risk hazards and two lower risk hazards.\n\nCouncil Authority/Previous Decisions:\n- On July 24, 2012, Council approved the first Climate Change Adaptation Strategy.\n- On December 3, 2013, Council received the Earthquake Preparedness Strategy.\n- On December 4, 2013, Council received a risk assessment related to the Transmountain Pipeline expansion, including assessment of coastal spill risk.\n- On December 5, 2018, Council approved the Climate Change Adaptation Strategy five-year update.\n- On April 23, 2019, Council approved the framework for the Resilient Vancouver Strategy.\n- On November 5, 2019, Council approved the Rain City Strategy.\n\nCity Manager's Comments:\nThe City Manager concurs with the foregoing recommendations.\n\nContext and Background:\nThe HRVA was designed to meet the requirements of the Emergency Program Act (EPA) and build on gaps staff had identified related to equity and disproportionate impacts of hazards. The new Emergency and Disaster Management Act (EDMA) also requires local authorities to assess risk and introduces new requirements.\n\nHazard risk assessment in Vancouver has been ongoing, with additional assessments and strategies informing mitigation, preparedness, and response actions.\n\nImportance of assessing hazard risk and disaster risk reduction:\nEmergencies and disasters continue to have significant impacts on cities. Understanding risks enables proactive risk reduction. Reducing disaster risk benefits social and economic development and can reduce costs to governments and society.\n\nMethod:\nThe HRVA was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 involved subject matter experts examining hazards and assessing their consequences and likelihood. Phase 2 supplemented this with feedback from communities disproportionately impacted by emergencies and disasters.\n\nHazard Risk Ratings:\nThe highest risk hazards are earthquakes and extreme heat events, followed by nine medium risk hazards and two lower risk hazards.\n",

The team worked closely with the City's Development Approvals Process (DAP) team and the project consultants, KPMG, to align the recommendations of the DAP report with the opportunities for continuous improvement in our EnerGov permitting software. This project has multiple phases: Phase 1 and Phase 2 were successfully delivered in 2023; Phase 3 is currently in progress and will deliver multiple business outcomes.\nStatus Update: In January 2024, privacy improvements were made to the My Permits Portal by tagging existing files already in the system so that only internal staff have access. This change also enables the upload of new attachments to applications post-submission by City's permit clients. Revenue Services benefited from automation to inform Tax when a new laneway permit is issued. The Building Department has visibility to the new permit status of \"preauthorized\" in-law suites. Effective February 2024, citizens can apply for Active Patio Permits (Boulevard, Curbside, and Sidewalk) and Engineering Residential Pre-Application approvals using the My Permits Portal. The Animal Issues Code Case Type was launched and access to new Animal Control Officers was provided for the benefit of community safety. A Finance report and four Engineering reports were added to the system to have improved visibility for business operational insights.\nIn March, a key milestone will be achieved with the Province. The City of Burnaby will be onboarded with the newly developed building permitting hub tool. This project is in alignment with City's efforts to streamline and standardize building permit processes in collaboration with other municipalities and the Province.\nAt the end of April, we expect to complete the upgrade of EnerGov to the latest version which will lead to enhanced product features and functionality, including Tyler Identity Client capability that enables single sign-on to allow applicants to use their existing social media log-ins.\n3.1.3 Customer Service Centre (CSC)\nProject Sponsor: Noreen Kassam\nProject Manager: Dario Sumano\nDescription: The Customer Service Centre (CSC) Project will centralize the intake, management and tracking of all service requests, inquiries, and feedback from City customers with an aim to improve external customer service and operational efficiency. The project will achieve this by deploying a centralized multi-channel customer service center with web, mobile app, phone, and in-person offerings, all managed by dedicated customer service staff.\nStatus Update: The Customer Service Center project team achieved significant milestones in 2023. They successfully completed division onboardings for Community Safety, Parking, Bylaw and Animal Control. Additionally, the project focused on streamlining case entry back to Engineering Transportation.\nThe team has ambitious goals for onboarding in Q2 of 2024. They plan to onboard divisions related to Crime Prevention and Anti-Graffiti. From a technology perspective, the project team made substantial progress by fulfilling most of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) requirements for an in-house Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. Leveraging these insights, we devised a strategy to engage vendor partners for implementing an off-the-shelf CRM solution. The CSC project created two Request for Proposals (RFPs) for licensing and implementation, aiming to deliver detailed plans and milestones for each major capability.\nThe project engaged vendors within a defined scope, budget, and timeline. The objective is to explore all available options to benefit the CSC Department and accelerate project results. Anticipating future needs, the CSC project plans to collaborate with vendors to build additional capabilities, such as Workforce Management and Quality Management to be enabled alongside the CRM soon after its implementation slated for 2025.\n3.1.4 Enterprise Content Management (ECM) & Governance System\nProject Sponsor: Juli Halliwell\nProject Manager: Saad Khan\nDescription: This project will transform the way the City stores and manages its documents, records, and other content. The new solution will look to increase staff efficiency by reducing time-consuming tasks around records storage and retrieval, augment compliance with applicable legislation and regulatory requirements, and improve privacy protection, access and transparency, document integrity and authenticity and assist the City to meet evolving legislative requirements for records management.\nStatus Update: File share data clean-up for the Office of the CAO is complete, and the Finance Department is near completion. We had a data clean-up kick-off with People & Culture in February, and it is anticipated that the data clean-up for that department will be completed at the end of April. Lands & Facilities and Engineering will be the next departments to participate in data clean-up starting May 2024.\nStoneShare was selected as the lead proponent during the Request for Proposal (RFP) process. The Scope of Work and Master Service Agreement were mutually agreed upon and signed after Council approval. The project team has started working on the discovery and planning phase with StoneShare and the target is to complete that phase by the end of April. This phase will include departmental consultations, a change management plan, project framework and project plans. In parallel, the project team also started a design phase which will cover system design, information architecture, data migration strategy, a test plan, and a governance plan.\n3.1.5 Modernizing Digital Workspaces: Email & Microsoft 365\nProject Sponsor: Bachar Khawajah\nProject Manager: Bhavan Mahal\nDescription: The goal of this project is to replace the current Microsoft Office environment with modern Microsoft 365 technology to improve efficiency, collaboration and advanced data visualization as well as migrate the City's email system from on-premises to cloud to improve user experience, accessibility, and security.\nStatus Update: The Microsoft 365 project team closed 2023 by migrating Parks, Recreation and Cultural Services (PRC) in November and Mayor & Council in December. Decommissioning of Jabber was completed in January 2024 and the Webex Calling app was deployed as part of an upgrade to Microsoft Teams. Zoom decommissioning is planned for the end of April 2024 and the number of Zoom licenses will be reduced as the City transitions to Microsoft Teams as the standard for virtual meetings. The project team is planning and executing a shared device rollout to staff across the City departments to be completed by the end of Q2. Shared mailboxes will be migrated to Exchange Online once the shared device rollout is completed. This project is near completion with minor changes to be completed in Q2.\n",

Permit the construction of 20 townhouse units at 9571, 9591, 9611, 9671 Steveston Highway and 10831 Southdale Road on a site zoned \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\".\n2. Vary the provisions of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 to reduce the minimum exterior side yard setback to Steveston Highway from 6.0 m to 4.5 m.\n\nOrigin\nDP 20-896138\nCLO Ventures K2 Ltd. (Directors: Xiangren Wu, Shengli Ling & Yan Li) has applied to the City of Richmond to develop 20 townhouse units at 9571, 9591, 9611, 9671 Steveston Highway and 10831 Southdale Road on a site zoned \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\". Three of the townhouse units are proposed to contain a secondary suite. The site currently contains five single-family dwellings that will be demolished.\n\nThe subject site is being rezoned from the \"Single Detached (RS 1/E)\" zone to the \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\" zone for this project under Bylaw 10082 (RZ 17-763712), which received Third Reading following the Public Hearing on October 21, 2019. A Servicing Agreement (SA 20-896440) is required as a condition of Building Permit issuance.\n\nDevelopment Information\nPlease refer to the attached Development Application Data Sheet (Attachment 1) for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements.\n\nBackground\nDevelopment surrounding the subject site includes single-family dwellings to the north, east, and west, and farm businesses on lots zoned \"Agriculture (AG 1)\" located in the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) to the south, across Steveston Highway.\n\nRezoning and Public Hearing Results\nThe Public Hearing for the rezoning of this site was held on October 21, 2019. No concerns about rezoning the property were expressed, and the rezoning bylaw received second and third readings. Informational signage has been installed on the property and no correspondence has been received regarding the proposal.\n\nStaff Comments\nThe proposed scheme has satisfactorily addressed the staff comments and complies with the intent of the applicable sections of the Official Community Plan (OCP), except for the zoning variances noted.\n\nZoning Compliance Variances\nThe applicant requests to vary the provisions of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 to reduce the minimum exterior side yard setback to Steveston Highway from 6.0 m to 4.5 m. The proposed variance is consistent with the Arterial Road Guidelines for Townhouses in the OCP, and the reduced setback allows for an increased setback along the north property line, adjacent to existing single-family development. The proposed 6.0 m setback to both the ground and second floors of the rear units provides an improved rear yard interface and enhances solar access. The location of the existing curb along Steveston Highway will not change, and the applicant has provided an acoustical report indicating the proposal will meet CMHC interior noise standards.\n\nAdvisory Design Panel Comments\nThe Advisory Design Panel (ADP) reviewed the proposal on August 19, 2020. The design response from the applicant has been included following the specific Design Panel comments.\n\nAnalysis\nThe building height of the rear units is 8.8 m (two storeys) in response to the single-family adjacency to the north, consistent with the Arterial Road Land Use Policy. The 6.0 m setback to both the ground and second floors of the rear units provides an improved rear yard interface and enhances solar access.\n",

Four of the 22 townhouse units are proposed to contain a ground-level secondary suite.\n\nThe site is being rezoned from the \"Single Family Detached (RS 1/E)\" zone to \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\" zone for this project under Bylaw 10088 (RZ 17-794300), which received Third Reading following the Public Hearing on October 21, 2019. The site currently contains seven single-family homes, which will be demolished.\n\nFrontage improvements were secured through the rezoning process and will be constructed through a separate Servicing Agreement (SA 19-852902); works include but not limited to: construction of a new 1.5 m wide concrete sidewalk next to the new property line; construction of a grass/tree boulevard (min. new 1.5 m wide) over the remaining width between the new sidewalk and the existing west curb of No. 2 Road; and installation of an additional hydrant north of the proposed driveway. The Servicing Agreement must be entered into prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\n\nDevelopment Information\nPlease refer to attached Development Application Data Sheet (Attachment 1) for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements.\n\nBackground\nDevelopment surrounding the subject site is as follows:\n- To the north, existing single family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" fronting No. 2 Road, which are all identified for townhouse development under the Arterial Road Land Use Policy.\n- To the east, across No. 2 Road, existing single family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/B)\" fronting Goldsmith Drive, a childcare centre on a lot zoned \"School & Institutional Use (SI)\" and a 133-unit townhouse complex zoned \"Town Housing (ZT72)- London I Steveston (No. 2 Road)\".\n- To the south, three existing single family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/E)\" fronting Wallace Road, which are all identified for townhouse development under the Arterial Road Land Use Policy.\n- To the west, existing single family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/B)\" fronting Sandiford Drive.\n\nRezoning and Public Hearing Results\nThe Public Hearing for the rezoning of this site was held on October 21, 2019.

The proposed townhouse development replaces seven single family homes with 22 townhouse units, representing a marginal increase in new traffic. The additional traffic can be accommodated within the existing capacity and geometry of No. 2 Road. The development will reduce vehicle conflict points on No. 2 Road by eliminating seven full movement driveways and replacing with a sole driveway restricted to right-in/right-out turn movements.\n2. Tree protection and potential damages to trees and hedges on neighbouring properties. Tree protection fencing is required to be installed on site. The developer will remove and replace existing wood fences along the north, south and east property lines.\n3. Security of neighbouring properties during demolition and construction. The developer will install a 6-foot tall construction fence along the property lines and a temporary gate at the front of 10231 property as a site entrance.\n",

(Layfield Plastics) for a Development Variance Permit to increase the maximum building height within the Industrial Business Park (IB1) zone, to accommodate an addition for polyfilm fabrication at 11120 Silversmith Place.\n\nDevelopment Information\nIn 2003 and 2012, Council approved Development Variance Permits to increase the maximum building height for this site to accommodate equipment towers and a polyfilm fabrication tower.\nThe subject variance request is for a proposed vertical addition to the building to accommodate a production line with a tower structure as part of the blown film polyethylene extrusion line.\n\nBackground\nThe subject site is surrounded by medium to large sized general industrial lots zoned \"Industrial Business Park (IB1)\". To the west are large lots zoned Agriculture (AG1) within the Agricultural Land Reserve.\n\nStaff Comments\nThe proposed building addition design has satisfactorily addressed staff comments and complies with the Official Community Plan and the IB1 zone, except for the requested zoning variance.\n\nZoning Compliance/Variances\nThe applicant requests to increase the maximum building height from 16 m to 19.5 m to accommodate the new polyfilm fabrication tower. Staff support the proposed variance as it would allow the existing business to expand on-site rather than relocate. The proposed addition would be compatible with the existing towers on the site.\n\nAnalysis\nThe majority of adjacent uses are similar light industrial facilities. The proposed 19.5 m tower will be located at the centre of the existing building, abutting the existing 30 m tower. The agricultural properties to the west are approximately 50 m away, separated by Shell Road, a canal, and the rail corridor.\n",

(on behalf of the property owners; Wai Hung Mak and Yuen Pui Szeto), has applied to the City of Richmond to develop a coach house at 10700 Aintree Crescent on a site zoned \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (RE1)\". The site currently contains a single-family dwelling, which the applicant indicates is occupied by rental tenants and is proposed to be demolished prior to construction.\n\nDevelopment Information\nSee attached Development Application Data Sheet (Attachment 3) for proposed development data and Zoning Bylaw requirements.\n\nExisting Site and Surrounding Context\nThe subject site is located in the Edgemere neighbourhood. A portion of this neighbourhood underwent a City-initiated rezoning in 2012 to \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (RE1)\" to allow infill development. The subject site fronts Aintree Crescent and backs onto a rear lane.\n\nSurrounding development includes single detached dwellings on large lots zoned \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (RE1)\".\n\nStaff Comments\nThe proposed scheme has satisfactorily addressed the significant urban design issues and other staff comments. It complies with the intent of the design guidelines for coach houses in the Edgemere neighbourhood and the \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (RE1)\" zone.\n\nAnalysis\nThe proposed coach house design is comparable to other new coach houses in the surrounding neighbourhood. It is located to minimize shadowing and provide suitable building separation. The majority of the floor space is on the ground floor. There are no windows on interior side yard elevations to address overlook concerns.\n\nThe primary façade and access to the coach house is off the rear lane, with a secondary pedestrian access from Aintree Crescent. The site plan provides on-site parking in compliance with the Zoning Bylaw.\n\nThe proposed exterior materials and colours for the coach house are intended to complement but not replicate the proposed main dwelling.\n\nA private patio is proposed for the coach house at grade on the east side, off the main floor living space.\n\n6763462\n",

Permit the required private outdoor space to be located in the front yard instead of the rear yard.\n\nWayne Craig, Director, Development (604-247-4625)\n\nOrigin\nSpeera Ventures Incorporated has applied to reduce the minimum rear yard requirement under the \"Compact Single Detached (RC2)\" zone from 6.0 m to 3.1 m and permit the required private outdoor space to be located in the front yard to facilitate the retention of an existing significant tree in the front yard of the future Lot 2 at 10620 Williams Road.\n\nDevelopment Information\nPlease refer to the attached Development Application Data Sheet for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements.\n\nBackground\nDevelopment surrounding the subject site includes single-family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\", \"Compact Single Detached (RC1)\" and \"Compact Single Detached (RC2)\" to the north, \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (RE1)\" to the south, and \"Compact Single Detached (RC1)\" to the east and west.\n\nRezoning and Public Hearing Results\nDuring the rezoning process, staff identified two variances to facilitate the retention of a significant tree in the front yard of proposed Lot 2: to reduce the minimum rear yard setback from 6.0 m to 3.1 m, and to permit the required private outdoor space to be located in the front yard instead of the rear yard. The Public Hearing for the rezoning was held on April 19, 2021, and no concerns were expressed.\n\nStaff Comments\nThe proposed development is generally in compliance with the \"Compact Single Detached (RC2)\" zone, except for the two variances. These variances are proposed to retain an existing healthy significant 97 cm caliper Cedar tree (Tree tag #001) in the front yard of 10620 Williams Road.\n\nZoning Compliance/Variances\n1) Reduce the minimum rear yard setback from 6.0 m to 3.1 m on the future Lot 2. Staff support this variance to allow for retention of the existing significant tree.\n2) Permit the required private outdoor space for Lot 2 to be located in the front yard instead of the rear yard. Staff support this variance as the required tree protection area in the front yard eliminates the opportunity for the required private outdoor space to be located in the rear yard.\n",

The site currently contains three commercial buildings.\n\nDevelopment Information:\nIn 2011, Council issued Zoning Amendment Bylaw 8808 and a Development Permit, which consolidated several zones on the site into a single \"Auto-Oriented Commercial (CA)\" zone and facilitated the development of the Mini Cooper dealership on the subject building.\nThe proposed improvements are limited to exterior renovations to the existing dealership building and landscape improvements along the Highway 99 frontage. There are no changes to the overall site plan and vehicle circulation approved via the previous Development Permit and no new variances.\n\nBackground:\nThe subject site is located at the corner of Cambie Road and Highway 99 and is designated 'Commercial' in the East Cambie Area Plan. The site contains three buildings, including the subject two-storey building at the south of the site abutting Highway 99.\n\nDevelopment surrounding the subject site includes an office, hotel, auto dealership, and townhouse neighbourhoods.\n\nStaff Comments:\nThe proposed scheme has satisfactorily addressed the significant urban design issues and other staff comments, and complies with the intent of the applicable sections of the Official Community Plan (OCP) and the Zoning Bylaw.\n\nAdvisory Design Panel Comments:\nThe proposed exterior alterations are limited in scope and will not impact the overall form, massing or site plan of the existing building, so it was not presented to the Advisory Design Panel.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe site is double-fronting, with frontages on Cambie Road and Highway 99.

The site currently contains two shipping containers used to store farm equipment and supplies, which would be removed.\n\nDevelopment Information\nPlease refer to the attached Development Application Data Sheet (Attachment 1) for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements.\n\nBackground\nThe subject site and surrounding area are located within the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR). Development surrounding the subject site includes agricultural operations on properties zoned \"Agriculture (AG 1)\" and partially designated as Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESA).\n\nPrevious Activities\nThe property had been previously treed until 2015, when the land was cleared without appropriate permission. The City required the previous owner to restore the Riparian Management Area (RMA) and submit a farm plan, which was accepted in 2016 and proposed to farm the site with blueberries.\n\nStaff Comments\nThe property is subject to ESA and RMA land use designations. Agricultural activities are exempt from these requirements, but residential development is subject to them. The owner proposes to farm the property with various vegetables and blueberries, and to build a single detached house. The Development Permit is to allow the construction of the proposed house within the farm home plate and address the associated ESA compensation.\n\nEnvironmentally Sensitive Area and Riparian Management Area\nThe property is designated \"Freshwater Wetland (FRWT)\" ESA and includes a 15 m wide RMA along the west and south property lines.

(Suraj Dhariwal), has applied to the City of Richmond, on behalf of the property owners (Guriqbal Singh Sandhar and Jasbir Kaur Sandhar), for permission to develop a coach house at 10240 Ainsworth Crescent on a site zoned \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (REI)\" (Attachment 1). A new single-family dwelling with a one-bedroom secondary suite has been recently constructed on-site.\n\nDevelopment Information\nPlease refer to the attached Development Application Data Sheet (Attachment 2) for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Zoning Bylaw requirements.\n\nBackground\nThe subject site is located in the Edgemere neighbourhood, generally bounded by No. 4 Road to the west, Williams Road to the north, Shell Road to the east, and Steveston Highway to the south. A portion of this neighbourhood underwent City-initiated rezoning to \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (REI)\" in 2012 to allow infill development in the form of granny flats or coach houses. A Development Permit (DP) application is only required for a granny flat or coach house. A DP is not required for the single-family dwelling currently under construction.\n\nThe subject site is located on a lot with an east-west orientation, fronting Ainsworth Crescent and has an existing lane located along the north and east property lines. Development surrounding the subject site is as follows: To the North: Across the lane, a single-family dwelling on a lot zoned \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (REI)\". To the South: A single-family dwelling on a lot zoned \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (REI)\". To the East: Across the rear lane, a single-family dwelling on a lot zoned \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (RE1)\" with vehicle access from the north lane. To the West: Across Ainsworth Crescent, a lot zoned \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (RE1)\" that contains a single detached dwelling and completed coach house (DP 15-712474).\n\nStaff Comments\nThe proposed scheme attached to this report has satisfactorily addressed the significant urban design issues and other staff comments identified as part of the review of the subject Development Permit application. It complies with the intent of the design guidelines for coach houses in the Edgemere neighbourhood contained in the City's Official Community Plan (OCP), and complies with the \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (REI)\" zone except the below noted variance.\n\nThe applicant has requested to vary the provisions of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 Section 8.14.6.3 to increase the maximum distance that a coach house is permitted to be located from the south interior property line on a lot with an east-west orientation from 2.0 m to 3.0 m. Staff supports the proposed variance as there is an existing lane to the north which further increases the separation between the subject site and the residential lot to the north thereby reducing the amount of shadow impact on the property to the north. The proposed variance does not interfere with the overall design of the coach house which is generally consistent with the Development Permit guidelines. The applicant has committed to providing a heat pump in the rear yard between the coach house and the principal dwelling and achieving Step 3 of the step code.\n\nThe proposed coach house design relates to the proposed single detached housing form, character, and scale of the surrounding neighbourhood. The proposed location of the coach house, which is set back between 1.2 m and 3.0 m from the rear lane provides an adequate buffer to the adjacent lot to the east. The majority of the floor space in the coach house building is proposed on the ground floor, and the portion of the floor space located in the upper half-storey is located in the middle of the overall building. There are no windows proposed on the south side elevation to address concerns of overlook into the neighbouring yard to the south. There are windows proposed on the east elevation of the coach house to provide passive surveillance of the lane and maximize light penetration.\n\nConsistent with the OCP guidelines for coach houses in the Edgemere neighbourhood, the proposed primary pedestrian entry to the coach house is from the rear lane, and secondary pedestrian access is proposed via a pathway from Ainsworth Crescent and via a pathway from the north lane where the parking area for the coach house is proposed. On-site pedestrian circulation is provided from the road and the lane throughout the property.\n",

The site is currently vacant. Westmark Development Ltd. has applied on behalf of the property owner, numbered company 1276425 B.C. Ltd. Directors of the numbered company are Raman Bains and Suneil Bains. There is no associated rezoning application. A Servicing Agreement is required as a condition of Development Permit issuance and includes, but is not limited to, public walkway, lane and service infrastructure improvements.\n\nDevelopment surrounding the subject site is as follows: To the North: A townhouse development on a property also zoned \"Town Housing (ZT23) - Laurelwood\" with vehicle access from the Lynnwood Drive cul-de-sac. To the South: Semi-detached dwellings on properties zoned \"Single Family Zero Lot Line (ZS24)\" with vehicle access from Lindsay Road.

To the West: A townhouse development on a property also zoned \"Town Housing (ZT23) - Laurelwood\" with vehicle access from the rear lane.\n\nPublic correspondence was received regarding the subject application, expressing concern regarding pedestrian safety for students in the road and lane, and requesting speed bumps along Lindsay Road and in the lane to slow traffic and address pedestrian safety. To accommodate pedestrians, this development would provide a new public walkway along the subject site's south frontage that connects to the existing walkways along the east and west sides of the subject site. In addition, as part of the required frontage improvements, speed bumps would be constructed in the east-west lane and north-south lane located to the south and east of the subject site. Should there be concerns after residents move into the proposed development, Transportation staff would review and confirm any traffic-related concerns raised by area residents. A public process would be conducted before decisions on the implementation of any such measures were made.\n\nDP 20-921387\n- Concern regarding existing parking along Lindsay Road and in the lane and a request for the development to provide sufficient on-site parking for residents and guests of the proposed development.\n- The development proposal meets all parking requirements of Zoning Bylaw 8500 for on-site resident and visitor parking. Any available on-street parking is not taken into account to meet development requirements.\n- Traffic Bylaw 5870 restricts on-street parking to no more than three hours between 8:00 am and 6:00 pm (residents parking in front of their home excluded). Residents may contact Community Bylaws with concerns for enforcement of the bylaw.\n- Request for visual cues to discourage illegal parking such as signage and road marking, and concern regarding existing parking blocking road visibility at the corner of Lindsay Road and Linfield Gate. Cars should be parked no less than 6 m away from a property line at a corner in compliance with Traffic Bylaw 5870. Residents may contact Community Bylaws with concerns for enforcement of the bylaw.\n- Request for a resident parking permit system. Traffic Bylaw 5870 has no provisions for a resident parking permit system. Residents may contact Community Bylaws with concerns for enforcement of on-street parking regulations.\n\nStaff Comments:\n- The proposed scheme has satisfactorily addressed the significant urban design issues and other staff comments.\n- It complies with the intent of the applicable sections of the Official Community Plan (OCP) and is generally in compliance with the \"Town Housing (ZT23) - Laurelwood\" zone, except for the zoning variance noted below.\n\nZoning Compliance/Variances:\n- The applicant requests to vary the provisions of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 to reduce the minimum setback from a public road from 6.0 m to 3.8 m (measured from the boundary of the public rights-of-passage (PROP) statutory right-of-way (SRW) along the eastern edge of the subject site).\n- Staff supports the proposed variance as it provides an attractive pedestrian-oriented frontage along the east lane frontage, improves tree retention, and accommodates public pedestrian improvements along the south lane frontage.\n- A 5.5 m wide statutory right-of-way (SRW) along the west edge of the site accommodates a public sidewalk, grass boulevard with street trees, and public parking.\n- The proposed setback will not impact pedestrian or vehicle circulation and is consistent with setbacks provided in the existing development north of the site.\n",

Studio Senbel Architecture & Design Inc. has applied to replace the existing wood siding with non-combustible siding (i.e. HardiPlank) at 3960 Chatham Street, zoned \"Steveston Commercial (CS2)\". The new siding will have the same appearance as the existing wood siding and will be painted to match. A Development Permit and Heritage Alteration Permit are required as the site is within the Steveston Village Heritage Conservation Area. The Richmond Heritage Commission supports the applications. The Advisory Design Panel did not review the minor alteration. The existing cedar siding is rotting and needs replacement. The proposal is to replace the cedar siding with non-combustible siding with a longer lifespan. No changes to the interior layout or use are proposed. The existing vinyl signs will be removed and replaced with new signs meeting current guidelines. The existing landscaping will remain, except for a small planter box removal. The proposed siding replacement is consistent with Development Permit Guidelines and will enhance the building's appearance. Staff recommend endorsing the Development Permit and Heritage Alteration Permit for Council's recommendation.\n",

    "text": "Here is the cleaned and formatted text from the PDF document:\n\nOrigin\nRandhill Construction Ltd. has applied to the City of Richmond on behalf of the property owner, Surjit Dixit, to reduce the minimum rear yard setback for the property at 11251 Clipper Court. This would permit the retention of an existing non-conforming sunroom on the ground floor and second storey deck that were constructed without a Building Permit. No new construction, nor changes to on-site parking or trees is proposed.\n\nBackground\nThe original home was constructed in 1976. Subsequent Building Permits were issued for a second floor addition in 1990 and a garage addition in 1998, which complied with the Land Use Contract (LUC) in place at the time. The LUC was discharged in 2016 and the property became subject to the RS1/B Zone.\n\nBetween 1998-2002, an unpermitted addition was constructed consisting of a games room, den and sunroom on the ground floor. The current owners purchased the home in 2016 believing all construction was legally permitted.\n\nIn 2019, the homeowner hired a contractor (Randhill Construction Ltd.) to address structural issues and fix leaks. Following repairs, the contractor installed a second storey deck above the roof. No Building Permits were obtained.\n\nIn 2021, staff became aware of the unauthorized construction upon receipt of a complaint. An inspection determined certain work was done without permits, and the owners were requested to apply for a Building Permit to address the unpermitted alterations.\n\nDevelopment Information DV 22-015216\nThe unpermitted addition encroaches into the required rear yard setback. A Development Variance Permit has been applied for to bring the construction into compliance.\n\nAnalysis\nThe \"Single Detached (RS1/B)\" zone requires a 6.79 m (22.3 ft.) rear yard setback for 60% of the first storey, and 8.5 m (27.9 ft.) for the second storey. The applicant seeks to vary the setback to 5.95 m (19.5 ft.) for a portion of the first storey, and 5.27 m (17.3 ft.) for a portion of the second storey.\n\nThe second storey deck was constructed for the owners' aging parents to provide outdoor access without stairs. Existing trees and foliage effectively screen the deck from neighbouring properties and the adjacent park/trail.\n",

(Incorporation number: BCl 165225; Directors: Yechuan Wu and Hongda Wu) has applied to the City of Richmond for permission to develop two six-storey buildings containing 339 rental units at 8880 Cook Road and 8751 Citation Drive on a site zoned \"Low Rise Rental Apartment (ZLR44)- Brighouse Village (City Centre)\". The site is being rezoned from \"Low Rise Apartment and Town Housing (ZLR32)- Brighouse Village (City Centre)\" to \"Low Rise Rental Apartment (ZLR44)- Brighouse Village (City Centre)\" for this project under Bylaw 10396 (RZ 21-932698) which received third reading on October 17, 2022. The site currently contains two apartment buildings with a total of 102 units, which will be demolished. The subject property was a strata owner-occupied apartment condo development that completed a \"strata windup\" process in July 2018 and then sold to the developer for redevelopment.\n\nKey components of the proposal include:\n• Approximately 20,107 m2 (216,430 ft2) of purpose-built market rental housing consisting of 271 market rental housing units.\n• Approximately 3,755 m2 (40,427 ft2) of purpose-built moderate-income rental housing based on BC Housing's Housing Income Limits (HILs) consisting of 68 moderate-income rental units.\n• A range of unit types from studio to three-bedroom apartment units, as well as two to three-bedroom townhouse units.

The building design will also meet Energy Step Code - Step 3.\n• Five publicly accessible open spaces (mini-pocket parks) at strategic locations along the periphery of the development with a total area of 379.7 m2 (4,087 ft2).\n\nAn associated Servicing Agreement (SA 23-021998) was secured through the Rezoning (RZ 21-932698) for the design and construction of the publicly accessible open spaces (mini-pocket parks). An associated Servicing Agreement (SA 22-025603) was also secured at Rezoning for road and engineering improvement works required with respect to the subject development. Works include road widening, traffic signal improvements, frontage improvements along all road frontages and utility upgrades.\n\nDevelopment Information\nPlease refer to attached Development Application Data Sheet (Attachment 1) for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements.\n\nBackground\nDevelopment surrounding the subject site is as follows:\nTo the North: Across Cook Road, a number of two-storey townhouses on properties zoned \"Low Density Townhouses (RTLl)\".\nTo the South: Across Citation Drive, a four-storey apartment condo on a property on \"Land Use Contract (LUC 025)\", with the underlying \"Low Rise Apartment and Town Housing (ZLR32)- Brighouse Village (City Centre)\" zone.\nTo the East: Across Garden City Road, a 16-storey apartment condo on Cook Road zoned \"Residential/Limited Commercial (ZMU3)- North McLennan (City Centre)\" zone, and Garden City Park located to the south of Alberta Road.\nTo the West: Across Pimlico Way, a number of two-storey townhouses on a property on \"Land Use Contract (LUC 025)\", with the underlying \"Low Rise Apartment and Town Housing (ZLR32)- Brighouse Village (City Centre)\" zone.\n\nRezoning and Public Hearing Results\nThe Public Hearing for the rezoning of this site was held on October 17, 2022. At the Public Hearing, concerns regarding the potential impact to neighouring developments, traffic, parking and tenant relocation support were expressed. Staff have also received similar inputs to the subject Development Permit application from an area resident. Responses to the concerns raised are provided below in italics.\n\n1. Potential impact to the adjacent properties including shadowing\nThe proposed buildings are a maximum of six-storeys. With its ample building setbacks, the project will have minimal overshadowing impacts to adjacent properties, each of which is separated by a road or drive aisle in addition to the setbacks. The retention of trees and planting of new trees plus the provision of numerous pocket parks will create social gathering spaces and variety in the building massing while contributing to the pedestrian realm.\n",

The subject property is split-zoned \"Roadside Stand (CR)\" and \"Agriculture (AG 1)\". The proposed roadside stand building includes 189.80 m2 (2,043 ft2) of indoor floor area and 110.18 m2 (1,186 ft2) of outdoor area.\n\nBackground:\nThe subject property previously contained a non-conforming roadside stand building, which was demolished in 2021 to construct the proposed new roadside stand building. The site currently contains a nursery farm operation, an agricultural building, and a single-family dwelling.\n\nSurrounding Development:\n- North: Single-family dwelling and farm operation on 1.87 ha lot zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\"\n- South: Single-family dwelling and farm operation on 0.88 ha lot zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\" \n- East: Across No. 5 Road, Buddhist temple on 0.34 ha lot zoned \"Assembly (ASY)\"\n- West: No access property on 4.12 ha lot zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\"\n\nConsultation:\nThe Food Security and Agricultural Advisory Committee unanimously supported the proposal.\n\nStaff Comments:\nThe Roadside Stand (CR) zone requires a minimum 8.0 ha farm operation, but the applicant's farm is 1.77 ha. The requested variance would allow the roadside stand to be located closer to No. 5 Road.\n",

The grants, totalling $18,612,514, will be recovered by a special property tax levy on eligible properties in the respective BIAs.\n\nCouncil Authority/Previous Decisions:\nUnder Section 456(1) of the Vancouver Charter, Council may by majority vote grant money to an applicant that has as one of its aims, functions or purposes the planning and implementation of a business promotion scheme. Section 455 defines 'business promotion scheme' as carrying out studies, improving/beautifying/maintaining streets/sidewalks/City-owned land/buildings/structures, removing graffiti, conserving heritage property, and encouraging business in one or more business improvement areas. Section 456(2) requires the grants be recovered through a special tax levy on Class 5 and 6 properties in the BIA area.\n\nCity Manager's Comments:\nThe City Manager concurs with the foregoing recommendations.\n\nContext and Background:\nFunding for Business Improvement Areas is advanced by Council as a grant and recovered through a special BIA tax levy only on BC Assessment Class 5 and Class 6 properties within a designated area. Council has enacted by-laws designating the BIA areas, lengths of terms, and maximum levy amounts. A not-for-profit society is designated to receive the grant/levy money in each area. All grants to BIAs are raised by the BIA tax levies.\n\nEach year, BIA boards obtain membership approval of their budgets, then submit them to the City for Council approval. Once approved, rating by-laws are prepared to authorize the levy on qualifying properties. Funding is released to the BIAs beginning in April and recovered in July through property taxes.\n\nPrior to expiry of a BIA's designation, the BIA may request Council consider re-designation (renewal) for a further term, which may involve significant levy increases.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe BIAs listed in Table 1 have submitted their proposed 2024-25 budgets for Council's approval and requested recoverable grants in the amounts shown in column A. The budgets and business promotion schemes were approved by the majority of members present at each BIA's annual general meeting in 2023 (column B).

Receive this report for information; and\n2. Authorize the City Clerk to bring forward the Newton Business Improvement Area Bylaw, 2024, No. 21043 (the \"Bylaw\") for final adoption.\nINTENT\nThe purpose of this report is to provide Council with the results of the Council Initiative process related to the renewal of the Newton Business Improvement Area (\"Newton BIA\") and to seek Council authorization to bring forward proposed amendments to the Bylaw for final adoption in order to renew the Newton BIA for a four-year term from April 1, 2024 to March 31, 2028.\nBACKGROUND\nA Business Improvement Area (\"BIA\") collects funds for specific purposes through a rate levied against benefitting properties in a specified area. The establishment of a BIA is an effective means for businesses in that locale to finance programs to help keep the catchment area healthy and prosperous. There are currently four BIAs in Surrey including the Cloverdale BIA, Downtown Surrey BIA, Fleetwood BIA, and Newton BIA.\nThe current term for the Newton BIA expires on March 31, 2024. At the November 20, 2023 Council meeting, Council approved the recommendations in Corporate Report No. R201; 2023, which authorized staff to undertake the necessary actions to facilitate the renewal of the Newton BIA using the Council Initiative process. Subsequently, the Bylaw was introduced and received third reading on December 4, 2023.\nSubsequent to a BIA bylaw being adopted by Council, BIA revenues are collected by the City through an annual tax levy on applicable Class 5 & 6 properties within the BIA area. The collected amount is transferred from the City to the BIA as outlined in the Community Charter and not exceeding the Council approved amounts.\nDISCUSSION\nThe Council Initiative process is a means of consultation where if at least half of the property owners, representing at least 50% of the assessed value of land and improvements in the BIA area register their dissent within 30 days of notification, the process would not proceed.\nPursuant to the Council Initiatives process, notices were sent out to the owner(s) of Class 5 and 6 properties within the specified area. These notifications included the estimated tax levy amount and provided the petition form. The purpose was to inform the impacted property owners of the City's intention to renew the Newton BIA for a four-year term, concluding on March 31, 2028. Recipients were advised of the 30-day period to petition against the proposed renewal.\nIn addition, public notification was provided in the Surrey Now Leader on December 14 and December 21, 2023.\nThe deadline for receiving petitions opposing the renewal of the Newton BIA was January 22, 2024. According to the Community Charter, to prevent the renewal, petitions must represent at least 50% of the landowners and 50% of the total assessed value.\nThere are approximately 146 property owners subject to the Newton BIA tax levy, with a collective estimated total assessed value of $1,047,784,700. By the deadline, a total of 31 petitions opposing the renewal were received, constituting 21.2% of property owners and 19.6% of the total assessed value.\nTherefore, due to the inadequate number of petitions, it is recommended that Council authorize the City Clerk to bring forward the proposed Bylaw for final approval.\nUpon Council's adoption of the Bylaw, the Finance Department will include the Newton BIA levy into the property taxes for applicable Class 5 & 6 properties to collect the revenues through an annual tax levy. The funds collected, not exceeding the Council approved annual amount, will then be transferred to the Newton BIA.\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the above, it is recommended that Council authorize the City Clerk to bring forward the Bylaw for final adoption.\n\nTerry Waterhouse\nGeneral Manager, Community Services\n\nAppendix \"I\": Corporate Report No. R201; 2023\nAppendix \"II\": Newton Business Improvement Area Specified Area\nAppendix \"III\": Certificate of Sufficiency\n",

Receive this report for information.\n2. Endorse the 60 Ave drainage pump station project and direct staff to submit an application to the 2024 Community Emergency Preparedness Fund - Disaster Risk Reduction – Climate Adaptation program intake due on March 28, 2024.\n3. Authorize the Mayor and City Clerk to execute the related funding agreement with the Province of British Columbia for the aforementioned project, should it be approved for funding.\n\nINTENT\nThe intent is to obtain Council endorsement of the 60 Ave drainage pump station project and submit an application for funding to the Province of British Columbia's 2024 Community Emergency Preparedness Fund - Disaster Risk Reduction – Climate Adaptation (\"CEPF DRR-CA\") program intake.\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe Provincial CEPF DRR-CA program offers diverse funding streams to aid First Nations and local governments in bolstering disaster preparedness and reducing risks from natural hazards amid climate change. The CEPF DRR-CA program has received $369 million in provincial contributions since 2017, and the Province announced a further $180 million contribution in early 2023.\n\nThe funding stream has three distinct categories, each contributing up to 100% of the cost of eligible activities.\n\nIn October 2023, the City applied for a $4.975 million grant as part of the 2023 CEPF DRR-CA intake, which included upgrades to the Upper Serpentine River dyke and Latimer Creek, as well as structural upgrades to the Fry's Corner Pump Station.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe City's 2024 CEPF DRR-CA program application includes the construction of a new drainage pump station near 16060 60 Avenue, as identified in the North Cloverdale Functional Plan study. This project meets the CEPF DRR-CA program requirements, supports drainage servicing in the Serpentine-Nicomekl floodplain, and has not been included in other funding applications.\n\nThe project will improve drainage service levels, achieve ARDSA drainage criteria, and reduce flood vulnerability of the catchment area. The pump station can be located within existing road allowance on 60 Avenue, eliminating the need for land acquisition.\n\nCONCLUSION\nSecuring funding through the 2024 CEPF DRR-CA program intake will allow the City to continue supporting the protection of vulnerable farmland against climate change-induced challenges such as riverine flood hazards. This funding will enable the City to implement critical projects and initiatives aimed at reducing flood vulnerability and strengthening the community's ability to withstand and recover from flood events.\n\nScott Neuman, P.Eng.\nGeneral Manager, Engineering\n",

Receive this report for information;\n2. Authorize the City Clerk to bring forward for First, Second and Third Reading the 2024 Development Cost Charge Bylaw, attached to this report as Appendix \"I\";\n3. Authorize staff to forward the 2024 Development Cost Charge Bylaw to the Provincial Inspector of Municipalities for approval and to grant the City approval to enact the Development Cost Charge Bylaw (\"Provincial approval\"); and\n4. Upon Provincial approval, authorize the City Clerk to bring forward the 2024 Development Cost Charge Bylaw for Final Adoption, as required.\n\nINTENT\nThe purpose of this report is to have the 2024 Development Cost Charge Bylaw (the \"DCC Bylaw\") brought forward for the required readings. Staff also seek authorization from Council to submit the DCC Bylaw for Provincial approval prior to its final adoption by Council.\n\nBACKGROUND\nSurrey has a long established DCC Bylaw, that is reviewed annually to ensure that the DCC rates are sufficient to fund the growth component of the 10-Year Servicing Plan for roads, water, sewer, drainage, and parkland acquisition. This review is typically completed by January of each year so that the new DCC Bylaw can be reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and enacted by May 15 of each year.\n\nDISCUSSION\nFor 2024, the City is seeking to increase its DCC's to address inflationary cost increases for capital construction. Pursuant to the Development Cost Charge Amendment Bylaw Approval Exemption Regulation (BC Reg 130/2010) of the Community Charter, municipalities can update the DCC Bylaw once in a 12-month period using Consumer Price Index (\"CPI\") without requiring Provincial approval of a 10-year servicing plan. Staff are proposing this standard CPI approach for 2024 given the City's current DCC reserves and industry and market pressures on housing affordability.\n\nThe proposed 2024 DCC rates and the estimated timeline for implementation are summarized in Appendix \"II\". A standard CPI increase of 4.3% will be applied to DCC rates for: Parkland Acquisition, Roads, Sewer, and Water. Drainage DCC rates are proposed to be held at 0% increase, as there are sufficient DCC reserves and sufficient funding for the current 10-Year Servicing Plan. In addition, the City is eliminating the West Clayton premium DCC because the City-wide DCC rates are sufficient to fund servicing in West Clayton.\n\nDevelopment Cost Charge Exemptions for Affordable Housing\nThe DCC Bylaw currently provides exemptions for three conditions, including for the construction of Not-For-Profit Rental Housing, which is defined as housing developed under a Memorandum of Understanding with the BC Housing Management Commission to address homelessness. In accordance with the Local Government Act, the DCC Bylaw is being proposed to be amended to broaden the conditions for DCC fee exemption to address housing affordability. The proposed changes to DCC waivers will require Inspector approval.\n\nThe proposed change to the City's DCC Bylaw would enable DCC fee exemptions for rental housing developments operated by \"public housing bodies\" as prescribed in the Residential Tenancy Act and Regulations on condition that: the units are subject to a legal agreement securing rental tenure for a minimum period of 60 years; and the rental units are wholly owned and operated by a public housing body or operated by a public housing body, pursuant to a legal agreement with the property owner. In the Surrey context, public housing bodies would include BC Housing, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, Metro Vancouver Housing Corporation, and any housing society that has an agreement regarding the operation of housing with the government of British Columbia, BC Housing, CMHC, the municipality or regional district.\n\nThe proposed DCC exemption would support the implementation of one of the initiatives included in the City of Surrey's Housing Accelerator Fund (\"HAF\") agreement with the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Surrey's HAF project includes a new development incentive program to provide rebates on DCCs and fees on affordable housing projects. The HAF budget includes funds to cover the affordable housing DCC and fee rebates over the next three years.\n\nLegal Services Review\nThis report has been reviewed by Legal Services.\n\nCONCLUSION\nCouncil's approval of the 2024 DCC Bylaw will establish the City's capital expenditure plan for the construction of engineering infrastructure and parkland acquisition that will service existing neighbourhoods and support new growth across the City.\n\nScott Neuman, P.Eng.\nGeneral Manager,\nEngineering\n\nLaurie Cavan\nGeneral Manager,\nParks, Recreation & Culture\n\nDon Luymes\nGeneral Manager,\nPlanning & Development\n\nAP/cc\n\nAPPENDIX \"I\"\nCITY OF SURREY\nBYLAW NO. 21174\nA Bylaw to impose development cost charges.\n\nWHEREAS:\nA. Pursuant to Part 14, Division 19 of the Local Government Act, S.B.C 2015, c.1, as amended Development Cost Charge Amendment Bylaw Approval Exemption Regulation, BC Reg 130/2010, and the regulations passed pursuant thereto, the Council of the City of Surrey may, by bylaw, impose development cost charges; and\nB. Development cost charges may be imposed for the purpose of providing funds to assist the City of Surrey to pay the capital costs of providing, constructing, altering or expanding sewage, water, drainage and highway facilities, other than off-street parking facilities, and providing and improving park land to service, directly or indirectly, the development for which the charges are being imposed.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, the Council of the City of Surrey, ENACTS AS FOLLOWS:\n\nTITLE\n1.

The existing trail does not have a continuous water's edge route, and pedestrians must exit the trail and walk along Deer Lake Avenue to cross the Deer Lake Brook.\n3.0 GENERAL INFORMATION: The preliminary concept design includes a 36.4-meter long, single-span feature bridge, a 100-meter boardwalk to the east, and a 35-meter boardwalk to the west, facilitating connection to the current trail. The design minimizes disturbance to existing trees and sensitive ecological areas, using composite materials for a 75-year lifespan and minimal maintenance.\n3.1 Concept Design: The 3-meter wide deck is consistent with the current trail and boardwalk dimensions, meeting the growing circulation capacity needs. A second 4-meter wide option was considered but had a 30% higher cost and potential for increased disruption.\n3.2 Project Timeline: The project is expected to take 12-24 months to complete, subject to obtaining environmental and archaeological permits. A design-build delivery method will be used to expedite construction.\n4.0 COMMUNICATION AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT: Staff will engage with First Nation Communities through the Archeological Impact Assessment process and provide regular project updates to the broader community.\n5.0 FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS: The Class C construction estimate is $3.7 million, with $1.75 million included in the 2024-2028 Financial Plan. The remaining $1.95 million will be requested in the 2025-2029 budget cycle. Operating costs are expected to be minimal due to the use of composite materials.\n",

A TCUP was originally issued for a three-year term on June 16, 2014 (TU 14-653009), and extended for an additional three years on May 17, 2017 (TU 17-763604). A new TCUP (TU 20-890944) was issued on April 20, 2020 and has since expired. The current application is for a new three year time period.\n\nFindings of Fact: A Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the proposal is provided in Attachment 2.\n\nSurrounding Development: Development immediately surrounding the subject site is as follows: To the North: Across Cambie Road, Aberdeen Neighbourhood Park on a lot zoned \"School & Institutional Use (SI).\" To the East: Single-family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" which are designated \"General Urban T4 (25m)\" in the City Centre Area Plan. To the South: Across Brownwood Road, single-family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" which are designated \"General Urban T4 (25m)\" in the City Centre Area Plan. To the West: Across Hazelbridge Way, Aberdeen Centre, which is a commercial centre on a lot zoned \"Residential Mixed Use Commercial (ZMU9) – Aberdeen Village (City Centre)\" and has portions of the site designated as \"Urban Centre T5 (35m)\" and \"Urban Centre T5 (25m)\" in the City Centre Area Plan.\n\nRelated Policies & Studies: The subject site is located in the Aberdeen Village area of the City Centre Area Plan (CCAP). It is designated \"Mixed Employment\" in the Official Community Plan (OCP), and is designated \"General Urban T4 (25 m)\" in the CCAP. The OCP allows Temporary Commercial Use Permits in areas designated \"Industrial\", \"Mixed Employment\", \"Commercial\", \"Neighbourhood Shopping Centre\", \"Mixed Use\", \"Limited Mixed Use\" and \"Agricultural\" (outside of the Agricultural Land Reserve) where deemed appropriate by Council and subject to conditions suitable to the proposed land use and surrounding area. It is recognized by both the applicant and staff that this area will be developed according to the City Centre Area Plan in the future. Permitting a parking lot would allow for productive use of the site until redevelopment occurs.\n\nPublic Consultation: A notification sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have received correspondence in the form of a letter outlining concerns about the application from the residents at 8451, 8400 and 8420 Brownwood Road. The letter outlines issues related to dust generation, landscape upkeep and management of garbage (Attachment 3). The applicant has attended to the site to confirm the landscaping is currently in good condition and has contracted their landscaper to conduct an additional site visit in early January in addition to the regular monthly maintenance. The applicant has also reached out directly to the neighbours, delivering a letter to each resident indicating their response to the neighbour's issues, as well as identifying a direct contact from the applic\n",

The subject property is currently occupied by two single-family dwellings, an active farm operation, and associated farm buildings and seasonal farm labour accommodation.\n\nBackground\nAs part of the subject farm operation's participation in the Federal Government's Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program (SAWP), Richmond Fire-Rescue (RFR) inspected the seasonal farm labour accommodation on the subject site in 2022. Although all deficiencies from a life and safety perspective were addressed, it was identified that the existing seasonal farm labour accommodation on-site required applicable Agricultural Land Commission (ALC) and City approvals, including an ALR NARU application and rezoning application.

The proposal is consistent with this designation.\nThe OCP and Farming First Strategy also include policy indicating that seasonal farm labour accommodation, as an additional residential use, may be considered so long as the accommodation is accessory to the principal agricultural purposes and helps to support a farm operation in the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR). The proposal is consistent with this policy.\n\nMinistry of Transportation and Infrastructure\nAs the subject site is located within 800 m of an intersection of a Provincial Limited Access Highway and a City road, this proposal was referred to the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MOTI). Confirmation has been received from MOTI indicating no objection to the proposal. Final approval from MOTI is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\n\nFloodplain Management Implementation Strategy\nThe proposal must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204.

    "text": "RECOMMENDATION: Endorse future use of Development Permits in Burnaby as outlined in the report dated February 14, 2024, and delegate approval to staff. The Planning and Development Committee received and adopted the report seeking Council approval of the Development Permit Transition process. The transition to a new Development Permit system aims to streamline development by being less reliant on rezoning. The report provides an overview of tools available to regulate development, proposes the use of Development Permits in Burnaby, and outlines the transition process. The history of Burnaby's current development approval process and the types of Development Permits available are discussed. Streamside Protection and Enhancement Areas and the need for a comprehensive program and process are also highlighted.\nEnabled through the Local Government Act Division 7, Sections 488 through 491, an OCP may designate Development Permit Areas (DPAs) for various purposes including protection from hazardous conditions, farming, revitalization of commercial areas, objectives for residential and commercial development form and character, energy conservation, water conservation, and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. DPs are commonly used to regulate development form and character based on adopted guidelines. However, a DP cannot vary land use or density from that permitted in the bylaw, except for health, safety, or property protection reasons, or vary zoning bylaw application for residential rental tenure. Recent amendments to the Local Government Act and provincial policy encourage local governments to transition from rezoning to pre-zoning for residential developments.\n",

Currently unrestored, in very poor condition and vacant; and Natural park assets (throughout the park and along River Road): view corridors and natural landscape assets including meadows, wooded areas, drainage ditches, hedgerows, the slough and historical pilings: currently not interpreted. A heritage conservation review of the buildings and other historical assets on the Site was conducted in 2014, and although they have significant historical value, they currently do not hold formal heritage designations. These assets have been identified by staff and considered by Council as a major facility project in the next 10 year timeframe. Additional Park Assets In addition to the abovementioned historical assets, two other assets fall within the Site that have been included in the Program Plan to ensure alignment of future uses for the Park as a whole. These assets include: Terra Nova Red Barn (2631 Westminster Highway): multipurpose room and commercial kitchen rented by community partners; and City-Owned Home (2380 Westminster Highway): a recently acquired residential house that is vacant. A map showing the included assets in the Program Plan can be seen in Attachment 1. Program Plan Development Process The development of the Program Plan is comprised of three phases. They are: Phase 1 (April 2023 to November 2023) Background research and site analysis; Development of Draft Guiding Principles; Guiding Principle Workshop with staff and community partners; Preliminary Public Outreach at Richmond Garlic Fest and Report to Council on draft Guiding Principles and next steps. Phase 2 (January 2024 to April 2024) Public engagement, including a Let's Talk Richmond survey and public open house; Refinement of engagement results; and Report to Council with Program Plan concept options. Phase 3 (May 2024 to September 2024) Identify and refine the preferred program plan; City staff and community partner charrette; and Report to Council with the completed Terra Nova Rural Park Historical Assets Program Plan. We are currently at the end of Phase 1 of the planning process. In order to further proceed with the Program Plan, Council's consideration and endorsement of the Program Plan Guiding Principles is required. Program Plan Guiding Principles The eight Guiding Principles (below) will inform the development of the Program Plan's concept options which will occur in Phase 2 of the process. Having the Guiding Principles in place will assist staff and community partners alike to ensure the completed Program Plan incorporates the values and goals contained within them. PARK ECOSYSTEM AND USES ARE BALANCED Balance the Park's unique rural character with wildlife, cultural and recreational uses. Activate and interpret the Park to minimize impacts to natural areas while maximizing the potential of active and passive recreation zones.\n",

RECOMMENDATION: THAT Council direct the City Solicitor to bring forward a bylaw to authorize entering into a Housing Agreement in respect to the 20 non-market housing units developed under the Rental Use Zoning Policy at 6438 Bymepark Drive, substantially on the terms outlined in this report. REPORT 1.0 INTRODUCTION On 2020 July 27, Council adopted Rezoning #I8-09, authorizing Polygon Homes (Polygon) to develop the property at 6438 Bymepark Drive with a five storey apartment building of 53 apartment units along with 43 townhouses. Subject to the initial 2019 Rental Use Zoning Policy, 20 units on the site are required to be inclusionary non-market rental units rented at Burnaby Affordable rates (i.e. 20% below CMHC Average Rents) and these units will be accommodated within the apartment building on the site. Tikva Housing Society (Tikva) successfully applied for BC Housing funds through the Community Housing Fund (CHF) program and approached Polygon to purchase and operate the non-market units. On 2022 May 9, Council adopted housing agreement business terms for all projects developed under the Rental Use Zoning Policy (RUZP). The adopted business terms have formed the basis of a forthcoming housing agreement template for all RUZP projects to facilitate expediency. The project at 6438 Bymepark Drive is the first RUZP project that staff have been advised of potential non-profit society purchase and operation of the non-market units within the development and the use of BC Housing funding. To: Chief Administrative Officer From: General Manager Planning and Development Re: Tikva Housing Society/Polygon Homes Housing Agreement Bylaw 6438 Byrnepark Drive Rezoning Reference U18-09 2023 January 6. Page 2 Pursuant to Section 483 of the Local Government Act, local governments may secure non-market or special needs housing through a Housing Agreement. Housing Agreements secure details such as rent levels, income testing requirements, and target populations, and are filed on land title under Legal Notations. Housing Agreements are the legal instrument that can be used to secure provisions when the local government does not own the land. All current and future owners of the development are subject to the terms of a Housing Agreement. Housing Agreements are adopted by bylaw and generally, are accompanied by Section 219 covenants for enforcement. Staff recommend the 20 non-market housing units within the larger development be secured through a Housing Agreement bylaw and Section 219 covenant. 2.0 POLICY CONTEXT There are several City policies that support the provision of non-market housing in Burnaby including: the HOME: Housing and Homelessness Strategy (2021), Burnaby Housing Needs Report (2021), Mayor's Task Force on Community Housing Final Report (2019), Corporate Strategic Plan (2022), Burnaby Social Sustainability Strategy (2011), Burnaby Economic Development Strategy (2007), and Official Community Plan (1997). The City's Rental Use Zoning Policy encourages non-profit operation of inclusionary non-market units. 3.0 DISCUSSION Tikva was selected as a successful proponent for BC Housing CHF funding for its proposal to purchase and operate 20 non-market rental housing units in Polygon's development at 6438 Byrnepark Drive. The CHF program specifically targets housing for families, seniors and persons with disabilities, and has prescribed rental rates and income eligibility criteria for all funded housing. The program requires three levels of affordability in each funded project: deep subsidy, rent geared to income and affordable market rental. The Housing Agreement terms for this project align with the terms for RUZP projects adopted by Council in 2022, except for affordability and income eligibility requirements. At its meeting on 2022 December 12, Council authorized staff to use an average of overall Inclusionary Unit rents for this and other RUZP projects that will be operated by non-profit societies using operating subsidies from BC Housing, as long as the average rent meets or exceeds the City's required affordability level under the Rental Use Zoning Policy. Additionally, the RUZP requires that all inclusionary unit tenants have incomes at or below BC Housing's Housing Income Limits (HILs). The CHF funding program allows for households with incomes above HILs to tenant the affordable market units. As such. Council authorized staff to allow tenant households of the affordable market units to have incomes not greater than BC Housing's low and moderate income limits. In summary, the Housing Agreement for this development will align with the Council adopted terms for RUZP projects, except that an averaging of rents will be used to meet the affordability requirement.\n",

Authorize introduction of Highway Closure Bylaw.\n4. Approve sale of City-owned property for inclusion in development site.\n5. Establish prerequisites for completion of rezoning.\nChief Administrative Officer's Comments: Concur with General Manager Planning and Development's recommendation.\nExecutive Summary: Rezoning application received for Phase 1 of Bassano Site Master Plan. Recommend forwarding to future Public Hearing.\nPolicy Section: Proposed rezoning consistent with various policies and plans adopted by Council.\nBackground: On July 25, 2022, Council granted Final Adoption to Rezoning Reference #17-14 for Bassano Site Conceptual Master Plan.\nDevelopment includes street-fronting townhouses. The subject site is Phase 1 of the three-phased Master Plan.\n\nOn October 04, 2021, Council approved a report endorsing a density and rental obligation transfer between the subject site and 5650 Beresford Street (Beresford Site), owned by the applicant. This transfer aims to create a fully non-market rental project at the Beresford Site. The Beresford Site will initially serve as rental housing for displaced tenants from development sites within the Metrotown Downtown Plan Area and beyond. These tenants will be relocated while their replacement rental unit is being constructed. The rental units will be delivered before or at the same time as Phase 1 of the Bassano Site. These units will fulfill the inclusionary rental requirement for Phases 1 and 2 of the Bassano Site, as well as the inclusionary requirement for the Beresford Site. Displaced residents from other developments can temporarily reside at the Beresford Site until their new unit is ready. Tenants will only be responsible for the portion of rent equivalent to their rent at the time of rezoning, with the developer paying any additional rent. Once Phase 3 of the Bassano Site is completed, the required rental units at the Beresford Site will revert to standard inclusionary rental rates, set at 20% below CMHC median market rates for the Southeast Burnaby rental survey area. Phase 3 of the Bassano Site will include a non-market rental podium to meet the overall inclusionary rental requirement for both the Bassano and Beresford Sites. Additional voluntary rental units at the Beresford or Bassano Site, utilizing RMr density, can be a mix of market and non-market rental units on a 1:1 basis as permitted under the Rental Use Zoning Policy. A density transfer between the two sites is proposed to facilitate this. Further details on the proposed swing site concept can be found in the Beresford Site rezoning report (Rezoning Reference #21-29), which is also on Council's agenda.\n",

Thereafter, these two parcels were consolidated and are now referred to together as 4330 Kingsway (see attached Sketch #1).\nThe initial purpose of the rezoning application was to rezone the consolidated site at 4330 Kingsway to the amended CD Comprehensive Development District (using the C3 General Commercial District as a guideline), in order to permit the renovation of the two existing commercial office buildings on the site. The proposed renovations include the recladding of the two office buildings and alterations to the site’s public realm and landscaping, as well as the addition of floor area with the intent of improving the street presence of the buildings. It is noted that 4370 Kingsway, improved with a two-storey commercial building occupied by a bank on the southwest corner of Kingsway and Kathleen Avenue, was not included as part of the subject rezoning application, although existing legal arrangements related to shared parking, loading, and access with the subject site were secured.\nAlthough the proposal did not align with the site’s high-density mixed-use designation under the Metrotown Downtown Plan, the rezoning advanced through a Public Hearing and received Second and Third Reading from Council on August 24, 2020 and June 28, 2021 respectively, on the basis that the proposal supports the retention of employment opportunities in the Metrotown area.\n3.0 GENERAL INFORMATION\nThe applicant has submitted a revised letter of intent to include the property at 4370 Kingsway, thus expanding the subject site to cover the entire block bounded by Kingsway, Kathleen Avenue, Kemp Street, and Wilson Avenue (see attached Sketch #1). In addition, the applicant intends to revise a portion of the development concept to redevelop the eastern portion of the site in line with the Metrotown Downtown Plan’s, high-density mixed-use development designation under the CD Comprehensive Development District (using the RM5s and RM5r Multiple Family Residential Districts, and the C3 General Commercial District as guidelines).\nThe revised proposal would replace the existing 10-storey commercial office building at the southeast corner of the site with a high-density mixed-use building comprised of both market and non-market dwelling units, and street-activating retail uses. The revised proposal also includes the replacement of the existing two-storey commercial building at 4370 Kingsway with a future commercial office building. The existing 19-storey commercial office building on the northwest corner of the site will be retained and re-cladded, as originally intended.\n",

The maximum permitted density for the redevelopment of the subject site is calculated based on the proportions of the different residential designations on the consolidated site.\n\nThe existing rental apartment buildings on the subject properties were built between 1955 and 1964 and have two to three storeys. There are currently 112 rental units across the five sites. Vehicular access to 6645 Dow Avenue is from a rear lane, while access to the other four properties is from Dow Avenue. The proposed CD Comprehensive Development District zoning includes the RM5r and RM4r Multiple Family Residential Districts to support the replacement of existing rental units and meet the City's Rental Use Zoning Policy requirements.\n",

Prepare a Rezoning Bylaw for First Reading and Public Hearing.\n2. Approve the amendment to the Brentwood Town Centre Development Plan.\n3. Authorize the introduction of a Highway Closure Bylaw.\n4. Approve the sale of City-owned property for inclusion within the development site.\n5. Establish prerequisites for the completion of the rezoning.\nChief Administrative Officer's Comments: I concur with the recommendation.\nExecutive Summary: A rezoning application has been received for the construction of Phase 1 of the Bassano Site Master Plan, consisting of a high-rise residential building with retail and underground parking. Recommend forwarding the application to a future Public Hearing.\nPolicy Section: The proposed rezoning application is consistent with various policies and plans adopted by Council.\nBackground: On July 25, 2022, Council granted Final Adoption to Rezoning Reference #17-14 for the Bassano Site Conceptual Master Plan. The intent was to guide site-specific rezoning applications for high-density apartment development.\nDevelopment, with street-fronting townhouses, comprises Phase 1 of the three-phased Master Plan. On October 04, 2021, Council approved a report endorsing a density and rental obligation transfer between the subject site and 5650 Beresford Street (Beresford Site), owned by the applicant. This transfer aims to deliver a fully non-market rental project at the Beresford Site. The Beresford Site will initially serve as rental housing for displaced tenants from development sites within the Metrotown Downtown Plan Area and beyond, while their replacement rental unit is constructed. The rental units will be delivered prior to or concurrently with Phase 1 of the Bassano Site. These units will satisfy the inclusionary rental requirement for Phases 1 and 2 of the Bassano Site, as well as the inclusionary requirement for the Beresford Site. Displaced residents from other developments can be housed at the Beresford Site until their unit in the new development is ready. Tenants will only be responsible for the portion of the rent equivalent to their rent at the time of rezoning, with the developer paying any applicable rent top-up. After the completion of Phase 3 of the Bassano Site, the Beresford Site's required rental units will revert to the standard inclusionary rental rates, set at 20% below CMHC median market rates for the Southeast Burnaby rental survey area. Phase 3 of the Bassano Site will include a non-market rental podium to meet the overall inclusionary rental requirement for both the Bassano and Beresford Sites. Additional voluntary rental units at the Beresford or Bassano Site, utilizing RMr density, can be provided as a mix of market and non-market rental units on a 1:1 basis as permitted under the Rental Use Zoning Policy. A density transfer between the two sites is proposed to facilitate this. Further details on the proposed swing site concept are outlined in the Beresford Site rezoning report (Rezoning Reference #21-29), which also appears on Council's agenda.\n",

In recognition of this milestone, a commemorative cross-Canada RCMP Musical Ride tour was organized and a performance took place at Swangard Stadium on June 26, 2023. The opportunity to host the Musical Ride was particularly meaningful for the community as it provided an opportunity to honour the memory of Constable Yang along with providing support to the local RCMP. The event was a success with approximately 3,700 tickets sold. In addition to the RCMP Musical Ride, the event was emceed by Kevin Lim and featured performances from the RCMP Lower Mainland Intergraded Police Dog Services, the “E” Division, Pipes, Drums and Dancers, Sardis Secondary Drum Line as well as the singing of O Canada by Stephen Scaccia. There were a number of activities for families and many participants opted to stay after the Musical Ride performance to enjoy a beautiful early summer evening at the stadium.\n3.0 GENERAL INFORMATION: The charitable donation portion of the RCMP Musical Ride is a requirement as stated in the Memorandum of Understanding signed with the RCMP in order to host the event.\nSubject: 2023 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Musical Ride\nOpen Council Meeting August 28, 2023 ....................................... Page 2\nIn 2018, the historical charitable donation of $10,000 was evenly split between Canadian Cancer Society - Cops for Cancer and Burnaby KidSport. In 2023, the charitable donation will be shared equally between Canadian Cancer Society – Cops for Cancer and the Honour House Society. The Burnaby RCMP decided on the Honour House Society for their continuing support for First Responders, Canadian Armed Forces personnel and Veterans while the members receive medical care. Specifically, they provided accommodations for the family members of Cst. Shaelyn Yang free of charge and have done so in the past for other family members of fallen officers.

The purpose of the subject rezoning application is to permit the construction of a five-storey enclosed self-storage facility with two levels of underground parking (see Attachment 1).\nAt the September 11, 2023 Council Meeting, Council raised questions relating to the provision of jobs through this storage use. Prior to Second Reading, Council asked that a staff report be submitted to respond to the questions raised. Staff spoke to the applicant who has expressed interest in pursuing the existing proposal. This report responds to Council's questions regarding the level of employment being achieved through this rezoning application.\n2.0 ISSUES RAISED\n2.1 Provision of Jobs\nQuestions were raised regarding the number of jobs supported by this application. The subject rezoning application is proposed as a self-storage facility business model specifically for small businesses. It follows the model of a self-storage facility that the applicant previously developed, constructed, and managed in Port Coquitlam from 2017-2022. This facility was utilized by residents as well as a wide variety of small and emerging businesses such as clothing companies, electricians, bakeries, IT companies, landscaping companies, and printing companies. These small businesses used this facility to store their inventory, supplies, equipment, and files in the secure and temperature controlled storage units. The facility also worked with logistics companies to store and receive packages on behalf of these small business. Therefore, while this facility only employed 5-6 individuals, it indirectly supported over 200 small businesses. With the clientele of small businesses in mind and the lessons learned from the Port Coquitlam self-storage facility, the applicant sought to provide this opportunity in Burnaby through this rezoning application. This self-storage facility is proposed to have 872 climate-controlled storage units ranging in size, bike lockers for employees, two levels of underground parking, two large industrial sized elevators, and intensive security systems for the broader facility as well as individual units. The fifth floor of the Burnaby self-storage facility is proposed to have a 2,187.2 sq. ft. amenity space that includes a kitchen, a washroom, a lounge area, a coffee bar area, a meeting room, as well as an outdoor amenity area (see Attachment 2). The facility is also located within a 900 m walking distance of the Gilmore SkyTrain Station, providing access for individuals and businesses across Metro Vancouver.\n2.2 Self-Storage Use in Industrial Zones\nConcerns were raised regarding self-storage uses in industrial zoning districts. The self-storage use is a permitted use for this site as set out in the City of Burnaby's Official Community Plan (1998) and Metro 2050 (2022) land use designations that permit industrial uses.\nIn the Burnaby Zoning Bylaw, self-storage uses are permitted in industrial zoning districts only. This proposed self-storage facility combines the M1 Manufacturing District and the M2 General Industrial District. This combination of zoning districts allows for a much more intensified use of industrial land by enabling a multi-storey industrial building. This aligns directly with the Metro Vancouver Regional Industrial Lands Strategy (2020) and City of Burnaby's Official Community Plan (1998), which outline the intensification of employment and floor space on redeveloping.\n",

Authorize the introduction of a Housing Agreement Bylaw according to the terms outlined in Section 3.17 of the report titled \"REZ #22-31A Southgate Master Plan Amendment and REZ #22-31B Site Specific Rezoning for a Portion of 7201 11th Avenue - Edmonds Town Centre Plan\" dated October 30, 2023, contingent upon the granting by Council of Second Reading of the Rezoning Bylaw for REZ #22-31B.\n2. Prepare a Rezoning Bylaw for REZ #22-31A and REZ #22-31B and advance it to First Reading and a Public Hearing at a future date.\n3. Establish prerequisites for the completion of the rezoning for the Master Plan Amendment (REZ #22-31A) and the Site Specific Rezoning (REZ #22-31B).\nExecutive Summary: A rezoning application has been received for the Southgate Neighbourhood. The proposed Master Plan amendment rezoning application (REZ #22-31A) aims to amend the Southgate Master Plan to facilitate future land uses and development in accordance with the City's Rental Use Zoning Policy. The proposed Site Specific rezoning application (REZ #22-31B) aims to permit the construction of a mixed-use development within the Courtyard Neighbourhood of the Southgate Master Plan area. The report recommends bringing forward the Rezoning Bylaws for First Reading and forwarding the rezoning application to future Public Hearings.\nPolicy Section: The proposed rezoning application is consistent with various policies and plans adopted by Council, including the Regional Context Statement, Corporate Strategic Plan, Official Community Plan, Edmonds Town Centre Plan, Economic Development Strategy, Social Sustainability Strategy, Environmental Sustainability Strategy, Climate Action Framework, Transportation Plan, Home Strategy, and Rental Use Zoning Policy.\nBackground: On July 20, 2015, Council granted Final Adoption to REZ #14-25, which established a Conceptual Master Plan framework for Southgate. The approved Southgate Master Plan permits a maximum residential density and includes provisions for different housing options.\nThe document states that there is a total area of 5,883,678 sq.ft. across five neighbourhood areas. A Density Allocation Covenant is in place to regulate the transfer of gross floor area (15%) between these areas.\n\nThe Southgate Master Plan was adopted, and on February 19, 2020, the Rental Use Zoning Policy (RUZP) was also adopted to support rental unit development in the City. The RUZP will be implemented through a Master Plan rezoning amendment in connection with this Site Specific Rezoning (SSR) application. Additional density of up to 2.20 for RM5r rental units and up to 1.10 FAR for RM5 density offset is proposed to meet the requirements of the RUZP.\n\nThe site area has been reduced from the original application due to redevelopment and construction in certain neighbourhoods. The RM5r and density offset will only be applied to the remaining phases, referred to as the \"Amendment Site Area\".\n\nFigure 1 shows a map of Southgate's neighbourhood areas and the original site area.\n",

Both buildings sit atop a 10-storey commercial podium, which includes a hotel with supporting amenities and ground-oriented retail units. The commercial podium allows for flexibility in occupancy, allowing the floor space to be utilized for offices or other employment generating uses as permitted within the C3 District.\n",

Recommend forwarding rezoning application to future Public Hearing.\nPolicy Section: Proposed rezoning application consistent with various policies and plans adopted by Council.\nBackground: Council previously granted Final Adoption to Rezoning Reference #19-19 for Brentwood West Conceptual Master Plan. Subject site comprises phases 1 and 2 of Master Plan, aiming for high-density mixed-use development and provision of housing options, employment opportunities, and public open space provisions.\nThe subject site is located at the southwest corner of Willingdon Avenue and Halifax Street, within the Council adopted Brentwood Town Centre Development Plan. It is designated for high-density mixed-use development, utilizing the RM5s, RM5r Multiple Family Residential Districts, C3 General Commercial District, and the Brentwood Town Centre Development Plan as guidelines. The site is approximately 7090.08 m2 (76,317 sq. ft.) in size and is comprised of three individual parcels and a portion of Buchanan Street, which is identified for closure under the Brentwood Town Centre Development Plan. Two of the parcels (4430 Halifax Street and 1801 Willingdon Avenue) are currently improved with older commercial buildings, and the remaining parcel at 4488 Halifax Street is vacant.\n\nOn 2023 February 06, Council received an initial rezoning report proposing to rezone the subject development site from its prevailing CD Comprehensive Development District to an amended CD Comprehensive Development District utilizing the RM5s Multiple Family Residential District, RM5r Multiple Family Residential District, C3 General Commercial District, and the Brentwood Town Centre Development Plan as guidelines. The applicant has now submitted a plan of development suitable for presentation to a Public Hearing.\n\nThe proposed development plan for the subject site is for two high-rise residential apartment buildings atop a non-market residential rental and commercial/retail podium with underground parking. The development is anticipated to be constructed over two main phases, with Phase 1 encompassing the western half of the site and Phase 2 the eastern half. However, the applicant has the flexibility and discretion to proceed with build out of both phases concurrently, should they decide to do so.\n\nPhase 1 of the development plan comprises a single 60 storey residential strata apartment building, a 9 storey non-market rental podium with townhouses fronting Buchanan Street, and locally scaled commercial retail units fronting Halifax Street. Phase 1 also includes a shared surface plaza accessed from Buchanan Street to accommodate loading, as well as a pedestrianized commercial arcade connecting Halifax Street through to Buchanan Street.\n\nPhase 2 of the development plan comprises a single 43 storey mixed-use tower, with market rental uses located on the upper floors, office uses in the podium, and locally scaled commercial retail units at the base of the building fronting all bounding streets and public spaces. As identified in the Brentwood Town Centre Development Plan and the adopted Brentwood West Conceptual Master Plan, Phase 2 also includes the closure of a portion of Buchanan Street for consolidation with the development site to enable the realization of a new public square.\n",

    "text": "To: City of Richmond Planning Committee\nFrom: Wayne Craig, Director, Development\nRe: Report to Committee\nDate: February 6, 2023\nFile: TU 23-009170\n\nStaff Recommendation:\nThe application by DA Architects & Planners for an extension to Temporary Commercial Use Permit (TCUP) for the property at 8991 Charles Street should be considered at a Public Hearing on March 20, 2023 at 7:00 p.m. in the Council Chambers of Richmond City Hall. The recommendation for consideration at the meeting is as follows:\nAn extension to Temporary Commercial Use Permit (TU 20-891050) should be considered for three years from the date of issuance. This permit would allow for a 'Vehicle Rental, Convenience' use, limited to the storage of rental vehicles only with no associated buildings and no public access as a site-specific additional use.\n\nWayne Craig\nDirector, Development\n(604-247-4625)\nWC:ak\nAtt. 4\n7114445\n\nREPORT CONCURRENCE\nPH - 92\nFebruary 6, 2023\n\nStaff Report\nOrigin: TU 23-009170\nDA Architects & Planners have applied to the City of Richmond for an extension to an existing Temporary Commercial Use Permit (TCUP) for the property at 8991 Charles Street. This permit would allow for the limited storage of rental vehicles with no associated buildings and no public access. The subject site is zoned \"Light Industrial (IL)\" and the TCUP would permit the outdoor storage of rental vehicles associated with the Routes Car Rental business at 9231 Beckwith Road. The original TCUP (TU 20-891050) was issued on March 16, 2020 for a three-year term expiring on March 16, 2023. The proposed TCUP extension would allow Routes Car Rental to continue storing rental vehicles on the subject site with no public access for up to three years from the date of issuance. There are no proposed changes to the layout or access permitted by the existing TCUP.\n\nFindings of Fact:\nThere are no existing buildings or structures on the subject property. The surrounding development includes the Bridgeport Canada Line Station and a bus loop to the north, office and warehouse buildings with parking and unoccupied lots to the south, a temporary modular housing development to the east, and the Bridgeport Canada Line Station and bus loop to the west.\n\nExisting Legal Encumbrances:\nTwo Statutory Right-of-Ways (SRWs) are registered on Title but do not impact the proposed use.\n\nRelated Policies & Studies:\nThe Official Community Plan (OCP) land use designation for the subject site is \"Commercial\" and the Bridgeport Sub-Area Plan designation is \"Urban Centre TS (45m)\". The proposed TCUP is consistent with these designations. The subject site is zoned \"Light Industrial (IL)\" which allows for a range of general industrial and commercial uses. The proposed TCUP would limit the use to the storage of rental vehicles with restricted access to operators only.\n\nLocal Government Act:\nTemporary Commercial Use Permits are valid for three years from the date of issuance. An application for extension to the permit may be made and issued by Council for up to three additional years. After this one-time extension, a new TCUP application would be required.\n\nPublic Consultation:\nNo comments have been received from the public regarding the TCUP application.\n",

(Directors: Ramneek Singh Padda and Satwant Singh Atwal), has applied to the City of Richmond for permission to rezone 7511 St. Albans Road (Attachment 1) from the \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" zone to the \"High Density Townhouse (RTH1)\" zone in order to permit the development of five three-storey townhouse units with vehicle access through an easement registered on Title of the adjacent property to the north at 7433 St. Albans Road. A preliminary site plan, building elevations and landscape plan are contained in Attachment 2.\nA Servicing Agreement will be required for this development to design and construct frontage beautification along St. Albans Road, relocation of an existing fire hydrant out of the proposed sidewalk and new service connections.\nFindings of Fact\nA Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 3).\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile: The site currently contains one single-family home, which will be demolished. The applicant has advised that the house on-site is rented out on a month-to-month basis; and there is no secondary suite in the house.\nSurrounding Development:\n- To the North: A seven-unit, two-storey townhouse development on a lot zoned \"Medium Density Low Rise Apartments (RAM1)\".\n- To the South: A four-unit, three-storey townhouse development on a lot zoned \"Town Housing (ZT45) - Gilbert Road, Acheson - Bennett Sub-Area, St. Albans Sub-Area, South McLennan (City Centre)\".\n- To the East: Across St. Albans Road, a 23-unit, three-storey townhouse development on a lot zoned \"High Density Townhouses (RTH4)\".\n- To the West: A four-storey apartment building on a lot zoned \"Medium Density Low Rise Apartments (RAM1)\".\nRelated Policies & Studies\nOfficial Community Plan: The 2041 Official Community Plan (OCP) Land Use Map designation for the subject development site is \"Neighbourhood Residential\" which includes areas where the principal uses are single family, two-family and multiple family housing (specifically townhouses).\nCNCL - 117\nMarch 6, 2023\n- 3 -\nRZ 18-818548\n6969884\nThe St. Albans Sub-Area of the City Centre Area Plan (CCAP) (Attachment 4), designates the subject development site for \"Multi-Family Low Rise (three-storey apartments, Townhouses, Two-Family or Single-Family Dwellings)\". The subject development proposal is consistent with these land use designations.\nUnder the Development Permit Guidelines in the CCAP, the subject development site is located within \"Sub-Area B.1: Mixed Use - Low-Rise Residential & Limited Commercial\", which is intended for lower-density conventional and stacked townhouses (i.e., typically with individual garages). The preliminary design of the proposal featuring conventional townhouses with individual garages generally complies with the CCAP Guidelines in terms of land use, density and overall neighbourhood character. Further consideration of the Development Guidelines and form and character will take place at the Development Permit stage of the process.\nThe subject development site is surrounded by properties with development potential subject to the CCAP. Registration of a legal agreement on Title is required before final adoption of the rezoning bylaw, stipulating that the residential development is subject to potential impacts due to other development that may be approved within the City Centre and requiring this information be provided through signage in the sales centre and through the disclosure statement to all initial purchasers.\nThe proposed rezoning is subject to a community planning implementation strategy contribution for future community planning initiatives. The applicant proposes to make a cash contribution at the current rate of $0.34 per buildable square foot, for a total contribution of $2,264.40 prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\nFloodplain Management Implementation Strategy: The proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\nAffordable Housing Strategy: The City's Affordable Housing Strategy requires that all townhouse rezoning applications provide a cash-in-lieu contribution toward the City's Affordable Housing Reserve Fund. As per the Strategy, townhouse rezoning applications inside of the City Centre Area Plan are required to provide a cash-in-lieu contribution of $18.00 per buildable square foot. Consistent with the Strategy, a contribution of $119,880.00 is required prior to the final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\nMarket Rental Housing Policy: This rezoning application was received prior to the current Market Rental Housing Policy adopted by Council on June 20, 2022. In keeping with Council policy, instream rezoning applications are exempted from the Market Rental Housing Policy if the project reaches first reading no later than June 20, 2023.\nCNCL - 118\n",

A map and aerial photograph showing the location of the subject site is included in Attachment 1. The proposed rezoning would permit the property to be subdivided to create two lots (Attachment 2), each with a principal dwelling and an accessory coach house above a detached garage, with vehicle access from the existing rear lane (Attachment 3).\nA new site-specific zone is being introduced to facilitate the proposed lot depth of 34.6 m (113.5 ft.), which does not meet the minimum required lot depth of the standard \"Coach Houses (RCH1)\" zone of 35.0 m (114.8 ft.). The proposed site-specific zone is identical in all provisions to the standard \"Coach Houses (RCH1)\" zone, but allows for a reduced lot depth.\nFindings of Fact\nA Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 4).\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile\nThere is an existing single-family dwelling on the subject property, which is proposed to be demolished. The applicant has confirmed the single-family dwelling is currently rented, and does not contain any secondary suites.\nSurrounding Development\nDevelopment immediately surrounding the subject site is as follows:\nTo the North: Single-family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" and further north \"Compact Single Detached (RC1)\" fronting No. 4 Road.\nTo the South: Single-family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" and further south \"Compact Single Detached (RC1)\" fronting No. 4 Road.\nTo the East: Across No. 4 Road, single-family dwellings on agricultural lots included in the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR), zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\".\nTo the West: Across the rear lane, single-family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/B)\" fronting Allison Court.\nPLN - 32\nMarch 21, 2023\n- 3 -\nRZ 17-777739\n7060982\nRelated Policies & Studies\nOfficial Community Plan/ Broadmoor Area - Ash Street Sub-Area Plan\nThe Official Community Plan (OCP) land use designation for the subject site is \"Neighbourhood Residential\" (NRES). The Broadmoor Area - Ash Street Sub-Area Plan designates the site as \"small lots or large lots\" (Attachment 5). The proposal is consistent with these designations.\nArterial Road Land Use Policy\nThe Arterial Road Land Use Policy identifies the subject site as \"Arterial Road Compact Lot Single Detached\", which allows for compact lot single detached or compact lot coach house development. The Arterial Road Land Use Policy requires all compact lot development to be accessed from an operational municipal lane only. Compact lot single detached (single detached housing with a secondary suite) is permitted on all compact lots with a minimum of 9 m width. Compact lot coach house (single detached housing with a detached coach house unit) is permitted on compact lots with a minimum 35 m lot depth. This proposal is to create a site-specific zone to allow for coach houses on lots with a minimum 34.5 m lot depth.\nThe Policy identifies that Rezoning for the construction of a coach house along an arterial road may be considered on isolated sites identified for Arterial Road Compact Lot Single Detached on the Arterial Road Housing Development map based on its own merit. The subject development has demonstrated that they are able to achieve all zoning and policy requirements on a slightly reduced lot depth so the proposed development is consistent with this Policy.\nAgricultural Land Reserve (ALR) Buffer Zone\nConsistent with the OCP guidelines, the applicant is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw, to register a legal agreement on Title to ensure that a 4.0 m wide landscaped Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) buffer (as measured from the east property line) along No. 4 Road is maintained and will not be abandoned or removed. The legal agreement will also identify that the property is potentially subject to impacts of noise, dust and odour resulting from agricultural operations. Submission of a Landscape Plan and cash securities to ensure the buffer area is appropriately landscaped is required prior to rezoning bylaw adoption. A preliminary landscape plan is included as Attachment 6, and is subject to further review to ensure that the plan meets all OCP guidelines. The application was not referred to the Agricultural Advisory Committee (AAC), as the committee has requested to review only higher density proposals near ALR land, and relies on staff to secure the landscaped buffer and legal agreement for single-family development.\nFloodplain Management Implementation Strategy\nThe proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\nPLN - 33\n",

The application is consistent with the associated Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) Non-Adhering Residential Use (NARU) application (AG 22-007162) approved by Council and the Agricultural Land Commission (ALC). A location map and aerial photograph are provided in Attachment 1. The subject property is currently occupied by a principal single-family dwelling, an additional single-family dwelling (the subject of the application), and an active farming operation.\n\nBackground: On September 12, 2022, Council authorized the associated Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) Non-Adhering Residential Use (NARU) application (AG 22-007162) to be forwarded to the Agricultural Land Commission (ALC). As per the ALC’s decision letter dated January 10, 2023 (Attachment 2), the ALC approved the proposal for a 64 m2 (689 ft2) addition to the existing additional single-family dwelling at 15140 Westminster Highway (Resolution #14/2023). The subject Zoning Text Amendment application is required to amend the “Agriculture (AG1)” zone in order to allow the addition at the subject site only.

(Directors: Ramneek Singh Padda and Satwant Singh Atwal), has applied to the City of Richmond for permission to rezone 7511 St. Albans Road (Attachment 1) from the \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" zone to the \"High Density Townhouse (RTH1)\" zone in order to permit the development of five three-storey townhouse units with vehicle access through an easement registered on Title of the adjacent property to the north at 7433 St. Albans Road. A preliminary site plan, building elevations and landscape plan are contained in Attachment 2.\nA Servicing Agreement will be required for this development to design and construct frontage beautification along St. Albans Road, relocation of an existing fire hydrant out of the proposed sidewalk and new service connections.\n\nFindings of Fact\nA Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 3).\n\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile\nThe site currently contains one single-family home, which will be demolished. The applicant has advised that the house on-site is rented out on a month-to-month basis; and there is no secondary suite in the house.\n\nSurrounding Development\nTo the North: A seven-unit, two-storey townhouse development on a lot zoned \"Medium Density Low Rise Apartments (RAM1)\".\nTo the South: A four-unit, three-storey townhouse development on a lot zoned \"Town Housing (ZT45) - Gilbert Road, Acheson - Bennett Sub-Area, St. Albans Sub-Area, South McLennan (City Centre)\".\nTo the East: Across St. Albans Road, a 23-unit, three-storey townhouse development on a lot zoned \"High Density Townhouses (RTH4)\".\nTo the West: A four-storey apartment building on a lot zoned \"Medium Density Low Rise Apartments (RAM1)\".\n\nRelated Policies & Studies\nOfficial Community Plan: The 2041 Official Community Plan (OCP) Land Use Map designation for the subject development site is \"Neighbourhood Residential\" which includes areas where the principal uses are single family, two-family and multiple family housing (specifically townhouses).\nThe St. Albans Sub-Area of the City Centre Area Plan (CCAP) designates the subject development site for \"Multi-Family Low Rise (three-storey apartments, Townhouses, Two-Family or Single-Family Dwellings)\". The subject development proposal is consistent with these land use designations.\nUnder the Development Permit Guidelines in the CCAP, the subject development site is located within \"Sub-Area B.1: Mixed Use - Low-Rise Residential & Limited Commercial\", which is intended for lower-density conventional and stacked townhouses (i.e., typically with individual garages). The preliminary design of the proposal featuring conventional townhouses with individual garages generally complies with the CCAP Guidelines in terms of land use, density and overall neighbourhood character. Further consideration of the Development Guidelines and form and character will take place at the Development Permit stage of the process.\nThe subject development site is surrounded by properties with development potential subject to the CCAP. Registration of a legal agreement on Title is required before final adoption of the rezoning bylaw, stipulating that the residential development is subject to potential impacts due to other development that may be approved within the City Centre and requiring this information be provided through signage in the sales centre and through the disclosure statement to all initial purchasers.\nThe proposed rezoning is subject to a community planning implementation strategy contribution for future community planning initiatives. The applicant proposes to make a cash contribution at the current rate of $0.34 per buildable square foot, for a total contribution of $2,264.40 prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\n\nFloodplain Management Implementation Strategy\nThe proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\n\nAffordable Housing Strategy\nThe City's Affordable Housing Strategy requires that all townhouse rezoning applications provide a cash-in-lieu contribution toward the City's Affordable Housing Reserve Fund. As per the Strategy, townhouse rezoning applications inside of the City Centre Area Plan are required to provide a cash-in-lieu contribution of $18.00 per buildable square foot. Consistent with the Strategy, a contribution of $119,880.00 is required prior to the final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\n\nMarket Rental Housing Policy\nThis rezoning application was received prior to the current Market Rental Housing Policy adopted by Council on June 20, 2022. In keeping with Council policy, instream rezoning applications are exempted from the Market Rental Housing Policy if the project reaches first reading no later than June 20, 2023.\n\nPH - 69\n",

December 8, 2022 – Canvassing of surrounding businesses to provide information about the development and information about the upcoming Public Hearing. February 22, 2023 – Follow-up engagement with Ora strata Council members (via Zoom) to present information about proposed changes to the project, lane design and measures to address traffic concerns. February 24, 2023 – Meeting with T&T Supermarket representatives (commercial tenant within the Ora development) (Via Zoom) to receive comments about existing lane operations and loading activities associated with T&T operations. March 20, 2023 – Canvassed existing Ora commercial tenants about the proposed project and lane operations.

The public correspondence and the City staff responses are included in Schedule C.\nA summary of the subject development’s proposed revisions to the project in response to the traffic concerns about access and impacts to the lane are provided below: Hotel pick-up and drop-off functions have been relocated from the lane to on-site within the subject development’s parkade. No pick-up and drop-off functions from passenger guest vehicles will occur from the lane. A gate with access control measures (i.e., intercom and electronic security device/FOB) will be installed for the lane access to the subject development’s parkade. This restriction will limit lane access to hotel guests and on-site employees only and reduce the introduction of additional traffic into the lane. The new west road access will serve as the primary vehicle entrance/exit to the subject development’s parkade and will be required to be utilized by residents, residential visitors, commercial uses and vehicles accessing the oval parking. Loading, servicing functions and a hotel shuttle parking with passenger loading area have been provided in dedicated areas on-site with direct access off the lane and designed to accommodate commercial trucks (i.e., maximum medium-sized SU-9 trucks). These changes are intended to address the traffic concerns raised and improve the overall traffic flow and safety in the area.\nPLN – 10\n",

(on behalf of Khalid Hasan of Pakland Qadri Gardens Ltd.) has applied to the City of Richmond for permission to rezone 7371 No. 4 Road from the \"Single Detached (RS1/F)\" zone to the \"Medium Density Townhouses (RTM2)\" zone, to permit the property to be developed for 19 townhouse units including two secondary suites, with vehicle access from General Currie Road. A location map and aerial photo of the subject site are provided in Attachment 1.\nFindings of Fact\nA Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is provided in Attachment 2.\nExisting Site Condition and Context\nA survey of the subject site is included in Attachment 3. The subject site is located on the northwest corner of the intersection of No. 4 Road and General Currie Road, and is currently accessed via No. 4 Road.\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile\nThe subject site consists of a large lot containing a single-family dwelling that is occupied by a rental tenant. There are no secondary suites in the dwelling. The existing dwelling is proposed to be demolished at future development stage.\nSurrounding Development\nExisting development immediately surrounding the subject site is as follows:\nTo the North: Is a large lot zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/F)\", containing a single-family dwelling, which fronts No. 4 Road, as well as a portion of a lot zoned \"Town Housing (ZT16) - South McLennan and St. Albans Sub-Area (City Centre)\" containing 22 townhouse units.\nTo the South: Immediately across General Currie Road, is a lot zoned \"Medium Density Townhouses (RTM3)\", containing 20 townhouse units.\nTo the East: Immediately across No. 4 Road, are large lots zoned \"Agriculture\" that are located in the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR), each of which contain single-family dwellings.\nTo the West: Are medium-sized lots zoned \"Single Detached (ZS14) - South McLennan (City Centre)\", each containing single-family dwellings fronting General Currie Road.\nPLN - 41\nApril 17, 2023\n- 3 -\nRZ 20-919143\n7183342\nExisting Legal Encumbrances\nThere is an existing Statutory Right-of-Way (SRW) registered on Title of the property for the sanitary sewer, water and drainage services along the front (east) property line. The applicant has been advised that encroachment into the SRW is not permitted.\nThere is also a notation on Title of the property to indicate that the subject site may benefit from a cross-access easement registered on Title of the existing townhouse site further north at 7331 No. 4 Road. This notation is not relevant to this development proposal because vehicle access to the subject site is proposed directly off General Currie Road, which is the preferred scenario as it avoids vehicle access off No. 4 Road and is supported by the City's Transportation department. Should this rezoning application proceed, the cross-access easement registered on Title of 7331 No. 4 Road in favour of the subject site may be discharged at the request of the strata council of 7331 No. 4 Road.\nRelated Policies & Requirements\nOfficial Community Plan/McLennan South Sub-Area Plan\nLand Use Designations\nThe Official Community Plan (OCP) land use designation for the subject site is \"Neighbourhood Residential\". This redevelopment proposal is consistent with this designation.\nThe McLennan South Sub-Area Plan land use designation for the subject site is \"Residential, 2 ½ storeys typical (3 storeys maximum), 0.55 base FAR\", and is identified as being in the \"C1 Character Area\", which is envisioned for clusters of housing contained predominantly in single, duplex, and triplex form and characterized by wooded areas (Attachments 4 & 5). The Sub-Area Plan allows for additional density to be considered where community benefits are provided (e.g., accessible housing beyond the typical provision; contribution to the child care reserve fund). This redevelopment proposal involving a density of 0.65 FAR is consistent with the Plan's land use designation for the subject site and character envisioned for this portion of the neighbourhood as it includes the retention of several trees on-site as well as the provision of four Convertible Units and two secondary suites. This proposal also provides road and pedestrian network improvements (including road dedication and a special crosswalk), and contributions to the Public Art Reserve Fund and Affordable Housing Reserve Fund.\nSite Size and Residual Lots\nTo encourage multi-family developments of sufficient size to support high quality development, the McLennan South Sub-Area Plan requires a minimum frontage width of 50 m along arterial roads and a minimum site area of 2,000 m2, and the creation of residual lots is avoided. Where a development proposal deviates from these requirements, it must be demonstrated that: access to the site is not off an arterial road and that future shared access to residual sites is enabled; the policy and design objectives of the Plan are not compromised; and the proposal provides a recognizable benefit to the area such as tree retention and enhanced pedestrian environment.\n",

Related Policies & Studies: Official Community Plan/Seafair Planning Area: The subject property is located in the Seafair planning area and is designated \"Neighbourhood Residential\" in the Official Community Plan (OCP). The proposed rezoning and subdivision are consistent with this designation. PLN - 23 April 17, 2023 RZ 22-027435 7140712 Arterial Road Policy: The subject property is designated \"Arterial Road Compact Lot Single Detached\" on the Arterial Road Housing Development Map. The Arterial Road Land Use Policy requires all compact lot developments to be accessed from the rear lane only. The proposed rezoning is consistent with this Policy. Prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw, the applicant must submit a Landscape Plan, prepared by a Registered Landscape Architect, to the satisfaction of the Director, Development, and deposit a Landscaping Security based on 100 per cent of the cost estimate provided by the Landscape Architect, including installation costs.

Similar applications to rezone and subdivide properties have been approved both to the north and south on the subject property along No. 1 Road. Existing Legal Encumbrances: None. Transportation and Site Access: Vehicular access to No. 1 Road is not permitted in accordance with Residential Lot (Vehicular) Access Bylaw No. 7222 and therefore will be restricted to the rear lane only.

A map and aerial photograph showing the location of the subject property is included in Attachment 1. The proposed subdivision plan is shown in Attachment 2. Findings of Fact: A Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 3). Subject Site Existing Housing Profile: There is an existing owner-occupied single-family dwelling on the subject property with vehicular access from Heather Street, which is proposed to be demolished. The applicant has confirmed there is no existing secondary suite in the dwelling. Surrounding Development: Development immediately surrounding the subject site is as follows: To the North: A single-family dwelling zoned \"Single Detached (RS2/A)\" fronting Heather Street that was previously rezoned (RZ 16-737446).

The City has considered a number of rezoning applications in the area, which have resulted in lots between 9 and 10 m wide (11 m for corner lots). The proposed rezoning and subdivision is consistent with this designation. PH – 7 March 6, 2023 - 3 - RZ 17-791280 7031674 Floodplain Management Implementation Strategy: The proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204.

Analysis: This redevelopment proposes to rezone and subdivide an existing single-family lot into two new single-family lots with vehicular access for Lot 1 (the corner lot) off Heather Street and access to Lot 2 off Dixon Avenue. This rezoning and subdivision is consistent with the lot fabric and vehicular access of lots to the north and south along Heather Street. Similar applications to rezone and subdivide properties have been approved in recent years along Heather Street. In keeping with the City's urban design objectives for enhanced design on corner lots, the applicant will be required to provide a landscape plan and register a restrictive covenant on Title to ensure that the development's design is consistent with the approved plans.

(on behalf of Khalid Hasan of Pakland Qadri Gardens Ltd.) has applied to the City of Richmond for permission to rezone 7371 No. 4 Road from the \"Single Detached (RS1/F)\" zone to the \"Medium Density Townhouses (RTM2)\" zone, to permit the property to be developed for 19 townhouse units including two secondary suites, with vehicle access from General Currie Road. A location map and aerial photo of the subject site are provided in Attachment 1.\nFindings of Fact: A Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is provided in Attachment 2.\nExisting Site Condition and Context: A survey of the subject site is included in Attachment 3. The subject site is located on the northwest corner of the intersection of No. 4 Road and General Currie Road, and is currently accessed via No. 4 Road.\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile: The subject site consists of a large lot containing a single-family dwelling that is occupied by a rental tenant. There are no secondary suites in the dwelling. The existing dwelling is proposed to be demolished at future development stage.\nSurrounding Development: Existing development immediately surrounding the subject site is as follows:\nTo the North: Is a large lot zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/F)\", containing a single-family dwelling, which fronts No. 4 Road, as well as a portion of a lot zoned \"Town Housing (ZT16) - South McLennan and St. Albans Sub-Area (City Centre)\" containing 22 townhouse units.\nTo the South: Immediately across General Currie Road, is a lot zoned \"Medium Density Townhouses (RTM3)\", containing 20 townhouse units.\nTo the East: Immediately across No. 4 Road, are large lots zoned \"Agriculture\" that are located in the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR), each of which contain single-family dwellings.\nTo the West: Are medium-sized lots zoned \"Single Detached (ZS14) - South McLennan (City Centre)\", each containing single-family dwellings fronting General Currie Road.\nPH - 184\nApril 17, 2023\n- 3 -\nRZ 20-919143 7183342\nExisting Legal Encumbrances: There is an existing Statutory Right-of-Way (SRW) registered on Title of the property for the sanitary sewer, water and drainage services along the front (east) property line. The applicant has been advised that encroachment into the SRW is not permitted. There is also a notation on Title of the property to indicate that the subject site may benefit from a cross-access easement registered on Title of the existing townhouse site further north at 7331 No. 4 Road. This notation is not relevant to this development proposal because vehicle access to the subject site is proposed directly off General Currie Road, which is the preferred scenario as it avoids vehicle access off No. 4 Road and is supported by the City's Transportation department. Should this rezoning application proceed, the cross-access easement registered on Title of 7331 No. 4 Road in favour of the subject site may be discharged at the request of the strata council of 7331 No. 4 Road.\nRelated Policies & Requirements\nOfficial Community Plan/McLennan South Sub-Area Plan\nLand Use Designations: The Official Community Plan (OCP) land use designation for the subject site is \"Neighbourhood Residential\". This redevelopment proposal is consistent with this designation. The McLennan South Sub-Area Plan land use designation for the subject site is \"Residential, 2 ½ storeys typical (3 storeys maximum), 0.55 base FAR\", and is identified as being in the \"C1 Character Area\", which is envisioned for clusters of housing contained predominantly in single, duplex, and triplex form and characterized by wooded areas (Attachments 4 & 5). The Sub-Area Plan allows for additional density to be considered where community benefits are provided (e.g., accessible housing beyond the typical provision; contribution to the child care reserve fund). This redevelopment proposal involving a density of 0.65 FAR is consistent with the Plan's land use designation for the subject site and character envisioned for this portion of the neighbourhood as it includes the retention of several trees on-site as well as the provision of four Convertible Units and two secondary suites. This proposal also provides road and pedestrian network improvements (including road dedication and a special crosswalk), and contributions to the Public Art Reserve Fund and Affordable Housing Reserve Fund.\nSite Size and Residual Lots: To encourage multi-family developments of sufficient size to support high quality development, the McLennan South Sub-Area Plan requires a minimum frontage width of 50 m along arterial roads and a minimum site area of 2,000 m2, and the creation of residual lots is avoided. Where a development proposal deviates from these requirements, it must be demonstrated that: access to the site is not off an arterial road and that future shared access to residual sites is enabled; the policy and design objectives of the Plan are not compromised; and the proposal provides a recognizable benefit to the area such as tree retention and enhanced pedestrian environment.\n",

No. BC 1388010 (Directors: Caterina Rizzo and Benny Taddei), to the City of Richmond for permission to rezone 9671 No. 1 Road from the \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" zone to the \"Compact Single Detached (RC2)\" zone, to permit the property to be subdivided to create two single-family lots, each with vehicle access from the rear lane. Findings of Fact: A Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached. Subject Site Existing Housing Profile: There is an existing unoccupied single-family dwelling on the property with vehicle access from the rear lane, which is proposed to be demolished. The applicant has confirmed that there is no existing secondary suite in the dwelling. Surrounding Development: To the North: A single-family dwelling on a property zoned \"Compact Single Detached (RC1)\" fronting No. 1 Road. To the South: A single-family dwelling on a property zoned \"Compact Single Detached (RC1)\" fronting No. 1 Road. To the East: Across No 1.

To the West: Across the lane, a single-family dwelling on a property zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" fronting Desmond Road. Related Policies & Studies Official Community Plan/Seafair Planning Area: The subject property is located in the Seafair planning area and is designated \"Neighbourhood Residential\" in the Official Community Plan (OCP). The proposed rezoning and subdivision are consistent with this designation. PH – 44 April 17, 2023 - 3 - RZ 22-027435 7140712 Arterial Road Policy: The subject property is designated \"Arterial Road Compact Lot Single Detached\" on the Arterial Road Housing Development Map. The proposed rezoning is consistent with this Policy. Prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw, the applicant must submit a Landscape Plan, prepared by a Registered Landscape Architect, to the satisfaction of the Director, Development, and deposit a Landscaping Security based on 100 per cent of the cost estimate provided by the Landscape Architect, including installation costs. The Landscape Plan should comply with the guidelines of the OCP's Arterial Road Policy and include any required replacement trees identified as a condition of rezoning. Floodplain Management Implementation Strategy: The proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw. Public Consultation: A rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have not received any comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the early public notification or placement of the rezoning sign on the property. Should the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the bylaw will be forwarded to a Public Hearing, where any area resident or interested party will have an opportunity to comment. Public notification for the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City's Zoning Bylaw 8500. Analysis: This redevelopment proposes to rezone and subdivide one existing single-family property into two new compact single-family lots with vehicular access from the rear lane. This rezoning and subdivision is consistent with the lot fabric and vehicular access of the adjacent lots on No. 1 Road. Similar applications to rezone and subdivide properties have been approved both to the north and south on the subject property along No. 1 Road. Existing Legal Encumbrances: None. Transportation and Site Access: Vehicular access to No. 1 Road is not permitted in accordance with Residential Lot (Vehicular) Access Bylaw No. 7222 and therefore will be restricted to the rear lane only.

    "text": "Report to Committee\nTo: Planning Committee\nDate: June 5, 2023\nFrom: Wayne Craig, Director, Development\nFile: RZ 18-843479\nRe: Revised Rezoning Considerations for the Application by Sian Group Investments Inc. for Rezoning at 7100 and 7120 Ash Street from the “Single Detached (RS1/F)” Zone to the “Town Housing (ZT16) - South McLennan and St. Albans Sub-Area (City Centre)” Zone\n\nStaff Recommendation:\n1. Rescind third reading of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500, Amendment Bylaw 10163, for the rezoning of 7100 and 7120 Ash Street, and revise the Rezoning Considerations to reflect changes to tree retention and replacement, as per Attachment D to this report.\n2. Grant third reading to Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500, Amendment Bylaw 10163, for the rezoning of 7100 and 7120 Ash Street from the “Single Detached (RS1/F)” zone to the “Town Housing (ZT16) - South McLennan and St. Albans Sub-Area (City Centre)” zone.\n\nWayne Craig, Director, Development (604-247-4625)\n\nREPORT CONCURRENCE\nCONCURRENCE OF GENERAL MANAGER\n\nPLN - 33\nJune 5, 2023\n\nRZ 18-843479\n7215969\n\nStaff Report\nOrigin: Sian Group Investments Inc. has applied on behalf of the owner, 1199445 BC Ltd. (Sukhinder Kaur Sian), to rezone 7100 and 7120 Ash Street from the “Single Detached (RS1/F)” zone to the “Town Housing (ZT16) - South McLennan and St. Albans Sub-Area (City Centre)” zone to permit the development of 17 townhouses. The original application by the previous owner was considered and the rezoning bylaw was granted third reading at the Public Hearing on May 19, 2020.\n\nAccording to new information provided by the project arborist about the condition of on-site trees since their original assessment in 2018, the current applicant/owner wishes to request changes to the proposed tree retention and replacement (Attachment A). For the rezoning application to proceed at this time, the existing rezoning bylaw (at third reading) must be rescinded and the Rezoning Considerations revised to reflect the proposed changes to the tree retention and replacement. An additional Public Hearing would not be required, as there is no resulting change to land use or density. The applicant would be required to satisfy the revised Rezoning Considerations prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\n\nFindings of Fact: Please refer to the original Staff Report dated March 23, 2020 for detailed information regarding the rezoning application (Attachment B). The original Staff Report includes information on the site context, relevant City policies, public consultation prior to the original Planning Committee meeting, staff comments on-site planning, vehicle access, tree retention and replacement, site servicing and frontage improvements.\n\nAnalysis: Tree Retention and Replacement\nTree retention and replacement originally associated with this proposal was the result of an assessment by the project arborist and City review of 23 bylaw-sized trees on the subject site and 13 trees on neighbouring properties. The outcome of tree retention and replacement at that time was that four on-site trees (Trees # 364-367) and 13 trees on neighbouring properties (Trees #OS1-OS13) were to be retained together with an appropriate cash security and that 19 on-site trees were to be removed and replaced at a 2:1 ratio, consistent with the City’s Official Community Plan (OCP).\n\nThe current owner purchased the property in 2021 and has since made progress with several aspects of the proposal, including:\n- Installation of tree protection fencing around the four on-site trees and 13 neighbouring trees to be retained.\n- Obtaining a T3 Tree Removal Permit for the on-site trees identified for removal to facilitate site preparation following the Public Hearing, and submission of a tree replacement security in the amount of $27,000.00.\n- Advancing the design of the required servicing and off-site improvements through the Servicing Agreement review process.\n- Advancing the Development Permit (DP) application to the Development Permit Panel on September 14, 2022.\n\nWith the new information provided by the project arborist this year (Attachment A), it is understood that there has been an observed natural decline in the condition of the four on-site trees that were originally identified to be retained such that they are not expected to recover (Trees # 364-367). The applicant’s Certified Arborist and Tree Risk Assessor has confirmed that the decline in health is the result of natural factors which could not have been predicted nor detected under means of industry standards. On this basis, the applicant is seeking to remove these four trees and plant an additional eight trees on-site, consistent with the 2:1 replacement ratio in the OCP. Each of the eight additional trees to be planted on-site are equal to or greater than the minimum replacement size specified in the City’s Tree Protection Bylaw 8057. The $40,000.00 tree survival security originally associated with retention of the four on-site trees is no longer required, and the eight additional replacement trees will be accounted for in the landscaping security associated with the Landscape Plan that forms part of the Development Permit.\n\nA comparison between the original proposal and the revised proposal is provided as follows:\n\nOriginal Proposal:\n- # Trees to be retained: 4 on-site trees (# 364, 365, 366, 367) and the provision of a $40,000 survival security, 13 trees on neighbouring properties (#OS1-OS13)\n- # Trees identified for removal: 19 on-site trees (# 358-363 and 368-380)\n- Replacement Tree Sizes: Min. Caliper Deciduous Tree - 6 cm, Min. Height Coniferous Tree - 3.5 m\n- Replacement Trees: 36\n\nRevised Proposal:\n- # Trees to be retained: 13 trees on neighbouring properties (#OS1-OS13)\n- # Trees identified for removal: 23 on-site trees (#358-380)\n- Replacement Tree Sizes: Min. Caliper Deciduous Tree - 8 cm, Min. Height Coniferous Tree - 4.0 m\n- Replacement Trees: 44\n",

This is to allow the property to be subdivided into two single-family lots. Vehicle access to the west lot (proposed Lot 1) is proposed from Ash Street, while vehicle access to the eastern lot (Lot 2) is proposed from a new extension of Armstrong Street. The site currently has an existing single-family dwelling on the western portion, which will remain on proposed Lot 1. A site survey showing the proposed subdivision plan is included.\nFindings of Fact:\nA Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached.\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile:\nThe existing single detached house is currently rented and does not contain a secondary suite. The existing tenants will remain in the dwelling following the rezoning and subdivision application.\nSurrounding Development:\nTo the North: A single-family dwelling zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/F)\" fronting onto Ash Street.\nTo the South: Two single-family lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS2/E)\" - one lot fronts onto Ash Street, while the other lot fronts onto Armstrong Street.\nTo the East: Across Armstrong Street, a single-family dwelling zoned \"Single Detached (ZS14) - South McLennan (City Centre)\" fronting onto Breden Avenue.\nTo the West: Across Ash Street, the City-owned Paulik Park.\nRelated Policies & Studies:\nOfficial Community Plan/City Centre Area Plan:\nThe Official Community Plan (OCP) land use designation for the subject property is \"Neighbourhood Residential\" (NRES).

Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\nPublic Consultation:\nA rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. No comments have been received from the public about the rezoning application in response to the placement of the rezoning sign. The adjacent property owner to the north at 7600 Ash Street has been contacted and has no specific objections to the rezoning application.\nAnalysis:\nProposed Rezoning and Subdivision:\nThe redevelopment proposes to rezone and subdivide the subject site into two single-family lots. The existing single-family dwelling on the western portion of the site will be retained (proposed Lot 1), and a new single detached house with a secondary suite will be constructed on the eastern portion of the site (proposed Lot 2). The existing dwelling meets all the requirements of the proposed zone upon rezoning and subdivision. This development proposal is consistent with the redevelopment along this block of Ash Street.\nTransportation and Site Access:\nVehicle access to the western lot (Lot 1) is proposed from Ash Street via the existing driveway location, while vehicle access to the eastern lot (Lot 2) is proposed from the new Armstrong Street.\n",

REPORT CONCURRENCE R OUTED TO: CONCURRENCE Transportation; CONCURRENCE OF GENERAL MANAGER PLN - 9 June 19, 2023 - 2 - RZ 21-941597 7234065 Staff Report Origin 1243059 BC Ltd. (Directors: Menghe Zhu and Zhe Yan Huang) has applied to the City of Richmond for permission to rezone 12120 No. 5 Road from the \"Agriculture (AG1)\" zone to the \"Light Industrial (IL)\" zone to permit the development of two multi-tenant industrial buildings for a total of 13 strata-titled units (Attachment 1). Temporary vehicle access will be from No. 5 Road and ultimate vehicle access from the rear lane to Rice Mill Road. Findings of Fact A Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 2). Surrounding Development The subject site fronts onto No. 5 Road and is currently vacant. To the North: A vacant lot zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\", outside the Agriculture Land Reserve (ALR) and designated \"Industrial\" in the Official Community Plan (OCP). The property is part of an active rezoning application (RZ 22-005648) to rezone the property to \"Light Industrial (IL)\" to develop a two-storey industrial building with vehicle access from an extension to the existing rear lane. The rezoning application is currently under staff review and will be presented to Council for consideration via a separate staff report. To the South: A single-family house on a lot zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\" outside of the Agriculture Land Reserve and designated \"Industrial\" in the OCP. To the East: A site containing the BC Ferries maintenance/operations harbour, split-zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\" and \"Light Industrial (IL)\" and designated \"Industrial\" in the OCP. The property is part of an active rezoning and Development Permit application (RZ 18-824565 & DP18-824566) to rezone to a site-specific zone in order to upgrade the fleet maintenance operations. The rezoning application is current at 3rd reading, while the DP application is under staff review. To the West: Immediately across No. 5 Road are Machrina Way and sites zoned \"Industrial Business Park (IB1)\" with warehouses and light industrial buildings. Related Policies & Studies Official Community Plan The Official Community Plan (OCP) land use designation for the subject site is \"Industrial\". The proposed rezoning is consistent with this designation. The site is zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\", but is not located within the ALR. PLN - 10 June 19, 2023 - 3 - RZ 21-941597 7234065 Floodplain Management Implementation Strategy The proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. The subject site is located in an area with a designated Flood Construction Level (FCL) of 2.9 m GSC. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw. Public Consultation A rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have not received any comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the rezoning sign on the property. Should the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grants first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the public will have an opportunity to comment further on all of the proposed amendments at the Public Hearing. Public notification of the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City's Zoning Bylaw 8500. Analysis Built Form and Architectural Character The proposed light industrial development consists of two buildings in a North-South arrangement with a bridging element over the drive aisle access to No. 5 Road. The two buildings total approximately 4,266 m2 in light industrial space and 1,276 m2 in ancillary office space. The buildings front No. 5 Road and have a proposed setback of 3.28 m from No. 5 Road and proposed height of 11.6 m, complying with Zoning Bylaw 8500. Conceptual development plans are provided in Attachment 3. Landscaping including tree replacement planting within the front yard setback, in conjunction with required frontage upgrades along No. 5 Road (multi-use pathway and landscaped boulevard), will improve the pedestrian scale of the development. In order to meet the minimum Flood Construction Level (FCL) of 2.9 m GSC as required in the City's Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204, the elevation of the subject site will be increased, resulting in the need for a retaining wall along the perimeter of the site. Fencing along the south property line will be used to screen the retaining wall and industrial-related activities from the adjacent residential property and will be limited to a maximum height of 2.4 m as measured from the averaged finish site grade. Transportation and Site Access Vehicle access to the site will be provided at the rear through the continuation and dedication of an existing lane established from Rice Mill Road. This lane is ultimately intended to extend south to the City-owned road allowance south of 12200 No. 5 Road. The ability to connect the lane to Rice Mill Road is contingent on the redevelopment of the site directly to the north, which is the subject of a current rezoning application (RZ 22-005648).

LTD. (Director: Salidran Kaur Bhullar), has applied to the City of Richmond for permission to rezone 10111 & 10113 No. 5 Road from the \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" zone to the \"Arterial Road Compact Two-Unit Dwellings (RCD)\" zone. This rezoning would permit the property to be subdivided to create three lots each containing a front-to-back duplex with vehicle access from the existing rear lane. A location map of the subject site is provided in Attachment 1.\nA Development Permit application is required prior to rezoning adoption to address the form and character of the proposed duplexes.\nFindings of Fact\nA Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is provided in Attachment 2.\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile: The subject site consists of a single lot containing a strata-titled non-conforming two-unit dwelling. The existing Strata Plan NW424 must be discharged from the Title prior to subdivision. Both units in the two-unit dwelling are currently tenant-occupied. The applicant has indicated that the two-unit dwelling also contains an unauthorized secondary suite in each unit, which are both being rented out. The applicant has notified the tenants of the proposed development and has not received any concerns to date. The existing dwelling is proposed to be demolished.\nSurrounding Development: Existing development immediately surrounding the subject site is as follows: To the North: One single-family dwelling on property zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\". To the South: One single-family dwelling on property zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\". To the East: Across No. 5 Road, a temple on property zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\" and \"Religious Assembly (ZIS7)\". To the West: Across the lane, a two-family dwelling on property zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\". The property is currently the subject of a rezoning application (RZ 22-010976) to create two single-family lots with access from Seabrook Crescent. The application is under staff review. This application will be the subject of a separate staff report.\nPLN - 13\nAugust 21, 2023\n- 3 -\nRZ 22-019002\n7255616\nRelated Policies & Studies\nOfficial Community Plan (OCP Designation): The Official Community Plan (OCP) Land Use Map designation for this property is \"Neighbourhood Residential\". The proposed rezoning and subdivision is consistent with this designation.\nArterial Road Policy: The subject site is identified as \"Arterial Road Compact Lot Duplex\" on the Arterial Road Housing Development Map. The proposed rezoning is consistent with this designation and complies with the \"Arterial Road Compact Lot Duplex Development Requirements\" under the Arterial Road Policy.\nLot Size Policy 5434: The subject site is located within the area governed by Single-Family Lot Size Policy 5434 (adopted by Council in 1990; amended in 1991 and 2006). This Policy permits rezoning and subdivision of lots along this section of No. 5 Road in accordance with compact lot single-family or coach house zoning (i.e. minimum width of 9.0 m with a maximum of two dwelling units per lot), provided that vehicle accesses are to be from rear lane only (Attachment 3). The Single-Family Lot Size Policy framework in general provides guidance with respect to the creation of new lots based on lot size and vehicle access. Lot Size Policy 5434 allows for the subdivision of the property to create new lots with the minimum lot width of 9 m, provided that vehicle access is from the rear lane only. This application will create three lots with vehicle access from the rear lane, consistent with the minimum subdivision standards in the Lot Size Policy. The OCP Arterial Road Land Use Policy provides direction on the use of the subject property for residential duplexes on the same size lots as permitted under Lot Size Policy 5434. Compact lot duplexes will result in the same number of dwelling units as achieved via a rezoning to coach houses. As such, the proposed rezoning is consistent with Lot Size Policy 5434.\nAgricultural Land Reserve (ALR) Buffer Zone: A landscape buffer is required along the No. 5 Road frontage of this site. The buffer is intended to mitigate land use conflicts between the residential uses on the subject site and any agricultural land uses on the east site, across from No. 5 Road. The applicant is proposing a 4.0 m wide ALR buffer on the site along the entire east property line (Attachment 4). In addition to the landscape buffer, a restrictive covenant will be registered on Title, indicating that the landscaping within the ALR buffer cannot be removed or modified without the City's approval. The covenant would also identify that the landscape planting is intended to be a buffer to mitigate the potential impacts of noise, dust, and odor generated from typical farm activities.\nPLN - 14\n",

The proposed subdivision plan and site plan are provided in Attachment 2. Findings of Fact A Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 3). Subject Site Existing Housing Profile This site is currently occupied by an existing duplex (two-family) dwelling, which will be demolished prior to subdivision. The existing two-family dwelling is owner-occupied and does not contain any secondary suites. Surrounding Development Development immediately surrounding the site is as follows: To the North: An existing strata-titled duplex on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”. To the South: Existing single detached houses on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”. To the East: An existing strata-titled duplex on a lot zoned “Two-Unit Dwellings (RD1)”. To the West: Single family dwellings on lots zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)” across Bonavista Gate. Related Policies & Studies Official Community Plan/Steveston Area Plan The property is designated as Neighbourhood Residential in the Official Community Plan (OCP), and as Single Family in the Steveston Area Plan (Attachment 4). This proposal is consistent with both of those land use designations. Floodplain Management Implementation Strategy The proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw. PLN – 4 October 3, 2023 - 3 - RZ 22-011063 7349947 Public Consultation A rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have not received any comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the placement of the rezoning sign on the property. Should the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the bylaw will be forwarded to a Public Hearing, where any area resident or interested party will have an opportunity to comment. Public notification for the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City’s Zoning Bylaw 8500. Analysis Proposed Rezoning and Subdivision The applicant is proposing to rezone the subject site and subdivide it into two single-family lots, each with a secondary suite, with access from Bonavista Gate. This development proposal is consistent with development in the area. The proposed subdivision plan and site plan are shown in Attachment 2. Staff worked with the applicant to modify the building envelope to enable retention of trees on site at the front and rear of the property. Existing Legal Encumbrances There is a 3.0 m wide Statutory Right-of-Way (SRW) in the backyard along the eastern property line for sanitary sewer utility purposes. The applicant has been advised that encroachment into the SRW is not permitted. A City Covenant is registered on both 10840 and 10860 Bonavista Gate Titles that restrict the development to a duplex, therefore, the duplex covenants must be discharged from Title prior to the final adoption of the rezoning bylaw. There is a Land Tax Deferment Act Agreement currently registered on the 10840 Bonavista Gate Title (proposed Lot A), which allows the property owner to defer the payment of taxes. All deferred taxes must be paid and the agreement must be discharged from Title prior to the preparation and registration of any legal documents associated with this rezoning application. Transportation and Site Access Vehicle access is proposed to be from Bonavista Gate for both of the proposed lots. The existing driveways will be removed and new driveways will be constructed as detailed in the Site Servicing and Frontage Improvements sub-section of this report. Two parking spaces will be provided for each dwelling unit in the garage. PLN – 5\n",

Site and Context\nThe subject site is located at 396 Southwest Marine Drive in the Marine Landing area of Marpole. It is one legal parcel with a total area of 12,615 sq. m and a frontage of 152.4 m along Marine Drive. The existing zoning is I-2 (Industrial) and the property is currently developed with a car dealership. Neighbourhood amenities include parks, schools, and community facilities.\n2. Policy Context\nThe Vancouver Plan, Marpole Community Plan, Employment Lands and Economy Review Phase 2 Report, and Marine Landing Policy Updates are relevant policy documents.\n\nFramework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The site is located within the Marpole Community Plan area which is generally in alignment with the Vancouver Plan. Marpole Community Plan (“Plan”) – The site is located in the Cambie neighbourhood of the Plan. Subsection 6.4.9 identifies this as an “intensive employment area” with direction to encourage high-intensity employment uses, including office, institutional, and industrial uses. At-grade retail may be supported only in conjunction with high-intensity job uses. The Plan establishes building heights for up to 100 ft. and a density of up to 3.00 FSR. Employment Lands and Economy Review Phase 2 Report: Emerging Directions for Consideration Through Vancouver Plan (“ELER”) – The ELER was a research initiative and includes analysis of Vancouver’s economy, changes over time, and future projections. The report identifies directions to guide future planning and engagement in the Vancouver Plan process with quick start actions to intensify job space in key areas. Quick Start Action 6 (b) considers additional heights and densities, beyond the provisions of the Plan, for intensive-employment sites that provide 100% employment space. This application is seeking additional height and density in accordance with this policy and the MLPU. Marine Landing Policy Updates (“MLPU”) – The updates provide guidance to evaluate rezoning applications in the Marine Landing area. The document supplements the Plan with directions regarding built form, public realm, transportation, and public benefits. Strategic Analysis 1. Proposal The rezoning proposal would permit two mixed-employment buildings (one 11-storey (56.9 m (187 ft.)) and one 19-storey (79 m (259 ft.)) above a three-storey podium (see Figure 2, and additional drawings in Appendix F).\n",

The application meets the intent of the policy, and staff recommend referring it to a Public Hearing with the recommendation to approve, subject to conditions.\n\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\n- Vancouver Plan (2022)\n- Secured Rental Policy (2012, last amended 2022)\n- RR-2B District Schedule (2021)\n- Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines (2021)\n- Housing Needs Report (2022)\n- Family Room: Housing Mix Policy for Rezoning Projects (2016)\n- High-Density Housing for Families with Children Guidelines (1992)\n- Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy (2019)\n- Community Amenity Contributions Policy for Rezonings (1999, last amended 2022)\n- Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (2010, last amended 2022)\n- Urban Forest Strategy (2014)\n\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site is comprised of four legal parcels fronting East 33rd Avenue. The site area is approximately 2,460 sq. m (26,477 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 60 m (198 ft.) along East 33rd Avenue and a depth of 40 m (131 ft.) along the east property line.\n\n2. Policy Context\n- Vancouver Plan: A land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City.\n- Secured Rental Policy: Encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing.\n- The proposed rezoning aligns with the Secured Rental Policy and supports the increase in rental housing supply.\n\nNote: The document continues with additional information and details.\nMultiple conversion dwellings located near public transit and local shopping, on the first full block of an eligible arterial road, may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to new residential rental zones. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials with below-market rental housing or social housing. This application complies with location criteria for six-storey buildings but is seeking five storeys without a below-market rental component.\n\nIn December 2021, Council approved the addition of three new residential rental zoning district schedules: RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C, and RR-3A and RR-3B. The RR zones set regulations for use, density, and height limits, with all residential uses secured as rental tenure and no stratification or sale of individual units allowed. The Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines provide further direction on form of development expectations under each RR zone.\n\nThe Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027) and the 3 Year Action Plan (2018-2020) aim to shift the supply of housing options and address the housing needs of the city.\n",

The amendment would allow for a six-storey mixed-use rental building with 20% of the residential floor area as below-market rental units.

Site and Context\nThe subject site is comprised of two legal parcels fronting West 41st Avenue. The site area is approximately 1,646 sq. m (17,717 sq. ft.) with a frontage of 43.3 m (142 ft.) along West 41st Avenue and a depth of 38.1 m (125 ft.).\n2. Policy Context\n- Vancouver Plan: A land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City.\n- Secured Rental Policy: Encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing.\nThe SRP outlines locational eligibility criteria for rezoning in low-density areas.\nSites that meet the criteria are eligible for rezoning.\nThese criteria and that are part of the typical street grid (including having lane or secondary street access to the rear) and are regular in shape, size and other attributes may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the new residential rental zones. The applicable option or options are further informed by the site’s size, orientation and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under the SRP for six-storey buildings. RR Zoning District Schedules and Design Guidelines – Along with updates to the SRP, in December 2021 Council approved the addition of three new residential rental (“RR”) zoning district schedules to the Zoning and Development By-law: “RR-1”, “RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C”, and “RR-3A and RR-3B”. Like other standard zoning districts, the RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines. Recognizing that the SRP and RR zones are intended to enable incremental change in neighbourhoods that currently consist primarily of detached houses and duplexes, the guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighbourliness and social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape which accommodates more architectural variety and diversity of housing options. Housing Vancouver Strategy – In November 2017, Council approved the Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027) and the 3 Year Action Plan (2018-2020). These seek to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply, with targets for new units along a continuum of housing.\n",

The surrounding neighborhood is primarily low-density residential.\nNeighborhood Amenities\n- Parks: Beaconsfield Park and John Hendry (Trout Lake) Park are nearby.\n- Community Centers: Italian Cultural Centre and Trout Lake Community Centre are nearby.\n- Transit: Nanaimo bus and Renfrew SkyTrain station are accessible.\n- Bicycle routes: Central Valley Bikeway and Sunrise bikeway are nearby.\nPolicy Context\n- Memorandum of Understanding (2020) (MoU) describes a partnership.\nThe Permanent Supportive Housing Initiative (PSHI) is delivering supportive housing on city-owned sites. The MoU was executed by BC Housing, the CMHC, and the City in 2020. Five projects are proceeding through this initiative to deliver a minimum of 300 new permanent, deeply affordable social housing units, with on-site and in-reach support services. Staff are prioritizing the processing and delivery of deeply affordable housing projects that leverage significant senior government investment to address housing inequity.\n\nThe Vancouver Plan, a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years, was approved by Council on July 22, 2022. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The site is located within the Renfrew Collingwood Community Vision. Implementation of the Vancouver Plan includes a review of all existing land use policies, including the Visions, to expand opportunities to address city-wide objectives. The proposal also addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy, which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\n\nThe Renfrew Collingwood Community Vision (2004) supports the provision of affordable housing for low-income households and urges senior governments to fund non-market housing. The Vision permits consideration of rezoning for social housing projects without further planning study.\n",

On April 27, 2022, Council resolved to receive a Housing Needs Report (HNR) prepared by staff. This zoning amendment would facilitate the delivery of social housing units and address the data and findings within the HNR. The Housing Vancouver Strategy seeks to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply and identifies the need to coordinate action with senior governments, non-profit, and Indigenous housing partners. 72,000 new homes are targeted for the 10-year period from 2018 to 2027, including 4,100 social housing units with supports.

Site and Context\nThe subject site at 817-837 West 28th Avenue and 4375 Willow Street is comprised of four legal parcels along 28th Avenue, west of Willow Street. The site area is approximately 2,344 sq. m (25,231 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 61.6 m (202.1 ft.) along 28th Avenue and a depth of 38.1 m (125.0 ft.). The current houses were constructed in 1944, 1945, and 2007 with tenants eligible for tenant protection.\nThe site and surrounding area are zoned RS-1, CD-1, or RM-8A. The RS-1 area is eligible for rezoning to RM-8A, for which a number of lots have been rezoned or contain an active rezoning application. Other uses in the area include Braemar Park and CD-1 districts for a community care facility, BC Women's and Children's Hospital, medical facilities, a synagogue, and a school.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan - The Vancouver Plan is a long-term land use strategy approved by Council in 2022. The site is located within the Cambie Corridor Plan, which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nCambie Corridor Plan - The Plan guides the transformation of the Corridor into an area for residential and commercial development. The site is located within the Queen Elizabeth neighborhood of the Plan, which calls for new ground-oriented housing opportunities.\nDesign Guidelines - The RM-8A/AN District Schedule is accompanied by clear design guidelines that establish expectations for new buildings.\nFurther, the RM-8AN District requires noise mitigation measures for buildings located on\nbased solely on the compliance of the proposal with the regulations and guidelines set out in the\nDistrict Schedule.\n2.\nHousing Diversity and Affordability\nThe proposed rezoning to RM-8A/AN supports the City’s goals of increasing housing diversity\nand affordability. The RM-8A/AN District Schedule allows for a mix of housing types, including\nground-oriented townhouses and apartments, which can accommodate a range of household\nsizes and incomes. The proposed development will contribute to the City’s affordable housing\nsupply.\n3.\nTransit-Oriented Development\nThe site is located within close proximity to transit services, including bus routes and the future\nSkyTrain station. The proposed rezoning to RM-8A/AN encourages transit-oriented development\nby providing housing options near public transportation, reducing reliance on private vehicles,\nand promoting sustainable transportation choices.\n4.\nNeighbourhood Character\nThe proposed development is designed to respect and enhance the existing neighbourhood\ncharacter. The building design and landscaping will be sensitive to the surrounding context and\nwill contribute positively to the streetscape. The proposed development will also provide\nadequate setbacks and open spaces to maintain a comfortable and livable environment for\nresidents and the community.\n5.\nCommunity Amenities\nThe proposed development will include community amenities such as outdoor gathering spaces,\nlandscaped areas, and pedestrian connections. These amenities will enhance the quality of life\nfor residents and contribute to the overall livability of the neighbourhood.\n6.\nPublic Consultation\nThe rezoning application has undergone a comprehensive public consultation process. The\napplicant has engaged with the community through open houses, information sessions, and\nfeedback opportunities. The input received from the public has been considered and\nincorporated into the design and planning of the proposed development.\n7.\nSustainability and Green Building Design\nThe proposed development will incorporate sustainable design principles and green building\nfeatures. This includes energy-efficient building systems, water conservation measures, and\nlandscaping that promotes biodiversity. The development will contribute to the City’s\nenvironmental goals and support a more sustainable future.\n8.\nParking and Transportation\nThe proposed development will provide on-site parking for residents and visitors. The number of\nparking spaces will comply with the City’s parking requirements. Additionally, the site’s proximity\nto transit services encourages the use of public transportation and reduces the need for private\nvehicle ownership.\n9.\nServicing and Infrastructure\nThe proposed development will be serviced by existing infrastructure, including water, sewer, and\nstormwater systems. The necessary upgrades and connections will be made to ensure the\ndevelopment is adequately serviced and does not place undue strain on the existing\ninfrastructure.\n10.\nConstruction and Phasing\nThe proposed development will be constructed in phases to minimize disruption to the\nneighbourhood. Construction activities will be managed to mitigate noise, dust, and other\npotential impacts on the surrounding area. The phasing plan will be implemented to ensure a\nsmooth and efficient construction process.\n",

Site and Context\nCurrently zoned RM-3A, the subject site is located on the northwest corner of North Templeton Drive and Oxford Street. The two frontages are 30.2 m and 37.2 m, with a total site area of 1,123.1 sq. m. The properties consist of two buildings with 13 rental units. All 13 units are tenanted with six tenancies eligible for protections under the Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy.\nLocal School Capacity - The site is in the catchment area of Hastings Elementary School and Templeton Secondary School. The Vancouver School Board (VSB)'s 2020 Long Range Facilities Plan anticipates that Hastings Elementary and Templeton Secondary will both be operating under capacity by 2031, at 65% and 61% respectively.\nNeighbourhood Amenities - The following amenities are within close proximity: Parks - Oxford, Templeton, Trillium, and Trinity; Cultural/Community Spaces - Quest Food Exchange, Kiwassa Neighbourhood House Annex, and Templeton Pool; Childcare - Montessori & More Learning Centre and Harbourview Day Care.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan - Approved by Council on July 22, 2022, the Vancouver Plan is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The site is located within the Grandview Woodland Community Plan which is generally in alignment with the Vancouver Plan.\nGrandview-Woodland Community Plan - The site is within the \"Residential Core\" character area of the \"Cedar Cove\" neighbourhood. This area is zoned RM-3A, consisting of purpose-built rental apartments.\nThe ODP requires existing rental housing to be maintained and allows for new rental housing to be introduced gradually. Subsection 6.3.1 of the Plan considers rezoning for 100% secured-rental housing in the Residential Core area, with a maximum of six storeys and an FSR of 2.4. The Plan aims to retain this area for affordable housing options, focusing on new rental housing surrounded by local shops, services, and improved public spaces. The Plan also established a \"pace of change\" policy to manage applications involving the demolition of protected market-rental housing. This policy limits redevelopment to five project sites or a maximum of 150 existing market-rental units in the first three years of the Plan. This project is one of the five eligible for redevelopment. Staff are currently renewing and updating the policy for Council's consideration later this year.\n",

The application meets the intent of the policy and should be referred to a Public Hearing.\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\nRelevant Council policies for this site include the Vancouver Plan, Secured Rental Policy, RR-2B Districts Schedule, Housing Needs Report, Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines, Family Room: Housing Mix Policy for Rezoning Projects, High-Density Housing for Families with Children Guidelines, Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings, Urban Forest Strategy, Latecomer Policy, Vancouver Development Cost Levy By-law No. 9755, and Vancouver Utilities Development Cost Levy By-law No. 12183.\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site is comprised of two legal parcels at the corner of West 45th Avenue and Granville Street. The total site area is approximately 2,273 sq. m (24,466 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 43.1 m (141 ft.) along Granville Street and a depth of 52.8 m (173 ft.).\n2. Policy Context\nThe Vancouver Plan, Secured Rental Policy, and other relevant policies support the rezoning of the site to RR-2B for the construction of a five-storey rental building.\nApplicable options or options are informed by site size, orientation, and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six-storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing.\n\nRR Zoning District Schedules and Design Guidelines - In December 2021, Council approved the addition of new residential rental (\"RR\") zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law; RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B, and RR-2C, and RR-3A and RR-3B. The RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed.\n\nFurther direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines. The guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighborliness and social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape which accommodates more architectural variety and diversity of housing options.\n\nHousing Vancouver Strategy - In November 2017, Council approved the Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027). These seek to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply, with targets for new units along a continuum of housing types. The Housing Vancouver targets were based on the core goals of retaining the diversity of incomes and households in the city, shifting.\n",

The amendment would allow for a five-storey rental building in accordance with the Secured Rental Policy (“SRP”). A future building design would be submitted through the development permit process and reviewed with the public at that time. Staff have assessed the application and conclude that it meets the intent of the SRP. Staff recommend that the application be referred to a Public Hearing, with the recommendation of the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability to approve it in principle, subject to the Public Hearing, and conditions contained within Appendix B.\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\nRelevant Council policies for this site include:\n• Vancouver Plan (2022)\n• Secured Rental Policy (2012, last amended 2022)\n• RR-2B District Schedule (2021)\n• Housing Needs Report (2022)\n• Housing Vancouver Strategy (2017)\n• Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines (2021)\n• Family Room: Housing Mix Policy for Rezoning Projects (2016)\n• High-Density Housing for Families with Children Guidelines (1992, last amended 2020)\n• Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy (2019)\n• Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (2010, last amended 2022)\n• Urban Forest Strategy (2014)\n• Latecomer Policy (2021)\n• Vancouver Development Cost Levy By-law No. 9755\n• Vancouver Utilities Development Cost Levy By-law No. 12183\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site (see Figure 1) is comprised of three legal parcels fronting Granville Street. The total site area is approximately 2,371.7 sq. m (25,529 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 57 m (187 ft.) along Granville Street and a depth of 45.7 m (150 ft.).\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\nThis property and the surrounding area are zoned for residential uses under the RS District Schedules with the exception of the C-1 area to the north that allows mixed-use development with commercial and residential uses. The site is currently zoned RS-1 and developed with three single-detached homes all constructed in 1926. The properties are not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Registry. Only one of the properties has a rental tenancy, and the Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy does not apply.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nSecured Rental Policy (“SRP”) – The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations. The SRP outlines the following locational eligibility criteria for sites in low-density areas:\n• In an existing RS or RT zone outside of recent community plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings);\nLocated near public transit and local shopping, on the first full block of an eligible arterial road. Sites meeting these criteria, part of the typical street grid with access to the rear, and regular in shape, size, and attributes may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the new RR zones. The applicable option or options depend on the site's size, orientation, and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials with a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. RR zoning district schedules and design guidelines were added to the Zoning & Development By-law in December 2021, including RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B, RR-2C, RR-3A, and RR-3B. The RR zones have basic regulations for use, density, and height limits, with all residential uses secured as rental tenure and no stratification or sale of individual units allowed. The Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines provide further direction on development expectations for each RR zone, supporting new missing middle buildings that foster neighborliness, social connection, and architectural variety. The Housing Vancouver Strategy, approved in November 2017, aims to shift the supply of new homes towards a diverse range of housing types, retaining the diversity of incomes and households in the city.\n",

Staff recommend referring the application to a Public Hearing with the recommendation to approve it in principle, subject to conditions.\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\n- Vancouver Plan (2022)\n- Secured Rental Policy (2012, last amended 2022)\n- C-2 District Schedule (1996, last amended 2022)\n- Housing Needs Report (2022)\n- Housing Vancouver Strategy (2017)\n- Family Room: Housing Mix Policy for Rezoning Projects (2016)\n- High-Density Housing for Families With Children Guidelines (1992)\n- Community Amenity Contributions Policy for Rezonings (1999, amended 2022)\n- Latecomer Policy (2021)\n- Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (2010, amended 2022)\n- Urban Forest Strategy (2016)\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\nSite and Context\nThis 1,558.5 sq. m (16,776 sq. ft.) site is located at the southwest corner of 16th Avenue and Arbutus Street in the Arbutus-Ridge neighbourhood. The site is zoned C-1 District and developed with an active gas station. Surrounding properties include a four-storey mixed-use building to the north and single detached houses to the east, south, and west. Rezonings for secured rental are permitted in the surrounding areas.\nNeighbourhood Amenities\n- Parks: Arbutus Greenway, Granville Park, Connaught Park, Angus Park, and Trafalgar Park\n- Community Spaces: Kitsilano Community Centre and Kitsilano Rink\n- Childcare Facilities: York House Little School, West Point Grey Day Care, Montessori Day Care, Arbutus-Ridge LIFT Early Learning Centre Inc., Maple Ranch Childcare Centre\nLocal School Capacity\n- Trafalgar Elementary School and Prince of Wales Secondary School are within the catchment area. Both schools are projected to operate under capacity by 2031.\nPolicy Context\nVancouver Plan (2022) - A land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City.\n\nVision: Implementation of the Vancouver Plan includes reviewing all existing land use policies, including the Visions, to expand opportunities for city-wide objectives.\n\nSecured Rental Policy: On November 26, 2019, Council approved amendments to the Secured Market Rental Housing Policy (Rental 100) and renamed it Secured Rental Policy (SRP). The SRP expands on Rental 100 by consolidating rezoning opportunities for secured rental housing previously in the Affordable Housing Choices Interim Rezoning Policy and introducing new green building requirements. Amendments to the SRP were adopted on December 14, 2021, allowing RS and RT zoned sites on arterials adjacent to large commercial areas to rezone to a new rental tenure district schedule.\n\nHousing Needs Report: On April 27, 2022, Council resolved to receive a Housing Needs Report (HNR) prepared by staff. Council must consider the most recent HNR when developing or amending a development plan in relation to affordable housing, rental housing, and special needs housing. This zoning amendment would facilitate the delivery of secured rental housing, including below market rental units, and address the data and findings within the HNR.\n",

The amendment would allow for a five-storey market rental building in accordance with the Secured Rental Policy (“SRP”). A future building design would be submitted through the development permit process and reviewed with the public at that time. Staff have assessed the application and conclude that it meets the intent of the SRP. Staff recommend that the application be referred to a Public Hearing, with the recommendation of the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability to approve it in principle, subject to the Public Hearing, and conditions contained within Appendix B.\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\nRelevant Council policies for this site include:\n• Vancouver Plan (2022)\n• Secured Rental Policy (2012, last amended 2022)\n• RR-2B District Schedule (2021)\n• Housing Needs Report (2022)\n• Housing Vancouver Strategy (2017)\n• Residential Rental District Schedules Design Guidelines (2021)\n• Family Room: Housing Mix Policy for Rezoning Projects (2016)\n• High-Density Housing for Families with Children Guidelines (1992, last amended 2020)\n• Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy (2019)\n• Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (2010, last amended 2022)\n• Urban Forest Strategy (2014)\n• Vancouver Development Cost Levy By-law No. 9755\n• Vancouver Utilities Development Cost Levy By-law No. 12183\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site (see Figure 1) is comprised of three legal parcels fronting Dunbar Street. The total site area is approximately 2,047.7 sq. m (22,041 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 51.8 m (170 ft.) along Dunbar Street and a depth of 39.5 m (129.6 ft.).\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\nThis site and the surrounding area are zoned for residential uses under the RS District Schedules. The site is currently zoned RS-5 and developed with three single-detached homes all constructed in 1946. The properties are not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Registry. The property contains one rental tenancy and the Tenant Protection Policy applies.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nSecured Rental Policy (“SRP”) – The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations. The SRP outlines the following locational eligibility criteria for sites in low-density areas: • In an existing RS or RT zone outside of recent community plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings); and • Located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping; and • On the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road. Sites that meet these criteria and that are part of the typical street grid (including having lane or secondary street access to the rear) and are regular in shape, size and other characteristics are eligible for rezoning under the SRP.\nAttributes may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the new RR zones. The applicable option or options are further informed by the site’s size, orientation, and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under SRP for five-storey buildings.\n\nRR Zoning District Schedules and Design Guidelines – Along with updates to the SRP, in December 2021 Council approved the addition of new residential rental (“RR”) zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law; RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B, and RR-2C, and RR-3A and RR-3B. Like other standard zoning districts, the RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines.\n\nRecognizing that the SRP and RR zones are intended to enable incremental change in neighborhoods that currently consist primarily of detached houses and duplexes, the guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighborliness and social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape which accommodates more architectural variety and diversity of housing options.\n\nHousing Vancouver Strategy – In November 2017, Council approved the Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027). These seek to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply, with targets for new units along a continuum of housing types. The Housing Vancouver targets were based on the core goals of retaining the diversity of incomes and households in the city, shifting housing production towards rental to meet the greatest need, and coordinating action with government and non-profit partners to deliver housing for the lowest income households.\n",

The amendment would allow for a five-storey market rental building in accordance with the Secured Rental Policy (“SRP”). A future building design would be submitted through the development permit process and reviewed with the public at that time. Staff have assessed the application and conclude that it meets the intent of the SRP. Staff recommend that the application be referred to a Public Hearing, with the recommendation of the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability to approve it in principle, subject to the Public Hearing, and conditions contained within Appendix B.\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\n• Vancouver Plan (2022)\n• Secured Rental Policy (2012, last amended 2022)\n• RR-2B District Schedule (2021)\n• Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines (2021)\n• Housing Needs Report (2022)\n• Family Room: Housing Mix Policy for Rezoning Projects (2016)\n• High-Density Housing for Families with Children Guidelines (1992)\n• Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy (2019)\n• Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (2010, last amended 2022)\n• Urban Forest Strategy (2014)\n• Latecomer Policy (2021)\n• Vancouver Development Cost Levy By-law No. 9755\n• Vancouver Utilities Development Cost Levy By-law No. 12183\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site is comprised of four legal parcels fronting Arbutus Street. The site area is approximately 3,957.3 sq. m (42,596 sq. ft.). The rezoning site includes a portion of the east/west lane. Conditions for the sale of the lane to the applicant are contained in Appendix B.\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\nThis property and the surrounding area are zoned for residential uses under the RS District Schedule. The site is currently zoned RS-5 and developed with three single-detached homes constructed in 1922, 1925, and 1926. The properties are not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register. The property contains two rental tenancies and both are eligible under the Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nSecured Rental Policy (“SRP”) – The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations. The SRP outlines the following locational eligibility criteria for sites in low-density areas:\n• In an existing RS or RT zone outside of recent\nCommunity plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings). Located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping. On the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road. Sites that meet these criteria and that are part of the typical street grid (including having lane or secondary street access to the rear) and are regular in shape, size and other attributes may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the new RR zones. The applicable option or options are further informed by the site’s size, orientation and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six-storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under SRP for five-storey buildings. RR Zoning District Schedules and Design Guidelines – Along with updates to the SRP, in December 2021 Council approved the addition of new residential rental (“RR”) zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law: RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C, and RR-3A and RR-3B. Like other standard zoning districts, the RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines. Recognizing that the SRP and RR zones are intended to enable incremental change in neighbourhoods that currently consist primarily of detached houses and duplexes, the guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighbourliness and social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape which accommodates more architectural variety and diversity of housing options. Housing Vancouver Strategy – In November 2017, Council approved the Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027). The strategy seeks to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply, with targets for new units along a continuum of housing types. The Housing Vancouver targets were based on the core goals of retaining the diversity of incomes and households in the community.\n",

    "text": "April 25, 2023, Yardley McNeill is the contact person with the phone number 604-873-7582. The RTS number is 15695 and the VanRIMS number is 08-2000-20. The meeting date is May 9, 2023. The recommendation is to refer the rezoning application for 3803-3823 West 10th Avenue to a Public Hearing. The recommendation is to approve the application in principle and to prepare the necessary by-law(s) for consideration at the Public Hearing. The application is to rezone the lands from RS-1 to RR-3B District. The recommendation is also to approve the draft zoning amendment by-law and the approvals are subject to the Conditions of Approval. The recommendation is to prepare a Housing Agreement By-law and to amend the Subdivision By-law. The recommendations are subject to certain conditions. The report recommends a plan amendment to rezone the site at 3803-3823 West 10th Avenue from RS-1 to RR-3B District. The amendment would allow for a six-storey mixed-use rental building with 20% of the residential floor area as below-market rental units. The application meets the intent of the Secured Rental Policy. The Council has made previous decisions related to this rezoning. The subject site is located at the corner of West 10th Avenue and Highbury Street. The site is currently zoned RS-1 and developed with three single-detached homes. The property contains three rental tenancies. The Vancouver Plan, Secured Rental Policy, and other policies are relevant to this rezoning.\nThe first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the new RR zones. The applicable option or options are further informed by the site's size, orientation, and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under the SRP for six-storey buildings.\n\nIn December 2021, Council approved the addition of three new residential rental (\"RR\") zoning district schedules to the Zoning and Development By-law: RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C, and RR-3A and RR-3B. The RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed.\n\nFurther direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines. The guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighbourliness and social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape which accommodates more architectural variety and diversity of housing options. The RR-3B District Schedule permits mixed-use residential buildings up to six-storeys in height and 3.4 FSR, with a minimum 0.35 FSR of non-dwelling uses. Residential uses are permitted only on the second storey and above. Non-dwelling uses on the ground floor may include.\n",

Site and Context\nThe subject site is located on the north side of West 39th Avenue, between Alberta and Cambie Streets. It consists of a three-lot assembly with a total site area of 1,770 sq. m. The lots contain three single-detached houses.\nThe surrounding area is primarily residential and commercial. Nearby properties have redevelopment potential.\nNeighbourhood Amenities\n- Public Parks: Queen Elizabeth Park, Columbia Park, Van Dusen Botanical Garden, Oak Meadows Park, and Montgomery Park.\n- Cultural Spaces/Community Spaces: Oakridge Centre, youth centre at 5812 Cambie Street, and artist live-work space at 5910 Cambie Street.\n- Childcare: Garderie L'ile Aux Enfants, expanded childcare at the Jewish Community Centre, and new childcare facilities at Oakridge Centre and Oakridge Transit Centre.\nLocal School Capacity: The site is within the catchment area of Sir William Van Horne Elementary.\nSchool and Eric Hamber Secondary School will be operating under capacity in the coming years, with a utilization rate at 88% and 86% respectively, by 2029. The Vancouver Plan is a land-use strategy approved by Council on July 22, 2022 to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The site is located within the Cambie Corridor Plan, which is generally in alignment with the Vancouver Plan. The properties are located within the Oakridge Municipal Town Centre (MTC) neighbourhood of the Plan. Redevelopment is guided by Subsection 4.3.6, which anticipates high-density residential off arterial areas. Policies support opportunities for affordable housing with improved streetscapes, parks, shops, and services. Specifically, Section 4.3.6.1 allows for residential buildings up to 18 storeys with 100% secured-rental housing with 20% of residential floor area as below-market rental (BMR) having rental rates, unit eligibility requirements, and operating requirements in accordance with the City’s Moderate Income Rental Housing Program (2017). The Plan also permits a partial storey for an indoor rooftop amenity space that is contiguous with outdoor amenity space. On April 27, 2022, Council resolved to receive a Housing Needs Report prepared by staff. Council must consider the most recent housing needs report and the housing information on which the report is based when developing a development plan, or when amending a development plan in relation to housing policies of the Council respecting affordable housing, rental housing, and special needs housing. This application implements Council-approved direction on housing contained in the Plan, which is well supported by the data and findings in the Housing Needs Report.\n",

Site and Context\nThe subject site is comprised of four legal parcels with a total area of approximately 3,688 sq. m. It is currently developed with four single-detached homes.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan - A land use strategy approved by Council in 2022.\nSecured Rental Policy - Encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing.\n\nSecondary street access to the rear and regular-shaped sites may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the new RR zones. The applicable options are determined by the site's size, orientation, and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six-storeys may be considered for projects on arterials with a minimum 20% below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under SRP for five-storey buildings.\n\nIn December 2021, Council approved new residential rental (\"RR\") zoning district schedules: RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B, RR-2C, RR-3A, and RR-3B. The RR zones set regulations for use, density, and height limits, with rental tenure and no stratification or sale of individual units allowed. The Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines provide further direction on form of development expectations under each RR zone, supporting new missing middle buildings that foster neighbourliness and social connection.\n\nThe Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027) aims to shift the supply of new homes towards the right supply, with targets for new units across a range of housing types. The strategy focuses on retaining income and household diversity, increasing rental housing production, and collaborating with partners to provide housing for low-income households. The strategy targets 72,000 new homes in 10 years, including 20,000 purpose-built rental units, with nearly 50% serving households earning less than $80,000 per year and 40% being family-size units.\n",

The amendment would allow for a four-storey mixed-use residential building in accordance with the Secured Rental Policy (“SRP”). A future building design would be submitted through the development permit process and reviewed with the public at that time.\nStaff have assessed the application and conclude that it meets the intent of the SRP. Staff recommend that the application be referred to a Public Hearing, with the recommendation of the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability to approve it in principle, subject to the Public Hearing, and conditions contained within Appendix B.\n\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\n• Vancouver Plan (2022)\n• Secured Rental Policy (2012, last amended 2023)\n• RR-3A District Schedule (2021)\n• Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines (2021)\n• Housing Needs Report (2022)\n• Family Room: Housing Mix Policy for Rezoning Projects (2016)\n• High-Density Housing for Families with Children Guidelines (1992, last amended 2020)\n• Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (2010, last amended 2022)\n• Urban Forest Strategy (2014)\n• Latecomer Policy (2021)\n• Community Amenity Contributions Policy for Rezonings (1999, last amended 2023)\n• Vancouver Development Cost Levy By-law No. 9755\n• Vancouver Utilities Development Cost Levy By-law No. 12183\n\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site is comprised of one legal parcel on the northeast corner of East 40th Avenue and Quebec Street. The site area is approximately 2,653.9 sq. m (28,566 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 70.4 m (231 ft.) along East 40th Avenue and a depth of 37.2 m (122 ft.).\nThis property and the surrounding area are zoned for residential uses under RS and RT District Schedules with the exception of the CD-1 and C-2 areas to the southeast that allows mixed-use development with commercial and residential uses. The site is currently zoned RS-1 and developed with a church constructed in 1956. The property is not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register.\nThe property contains no rental tenancies and the tenant protection policy does not apply.\n\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan - The Vancouver Plan is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nSecured Rental Policy (SRP) - The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping, and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations.\nThe SRP outlines locational eligibility criteria for sites in low-density areas, including being in an existing RS or RT zone outside of recent community plan areas, located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping, and on the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road.\nThe SRP allows for rezoning of regular-shaped sites to new residential rental zones based on size, orientation, and adjacent context. It supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Projects on arterials may go up to six-storeys if they include below-market rental housing or social housing. This application complies with the criteria for off-arterial four-storey mixed-use buildings under the SRP.\n\nIn December 2021, Council added new residential rental zoning district schedules (RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B, RR-2C, RR-3A, and RR-3B) to the Zoning & Development By-law. These zones have regulations for permitted use, density, and height limits, and all residential uses are secured as rental tenure with no stratification or sale of individual units allowed. The Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines provide further direction on development expectations for each RR zone.\n\nThe Housing Vancouver Strategy, approved in November 2017, aims to shift the supply of new homes towards rental housing. The strategy targets 72,000 new homes over 10 years, including 12,000 social, supportive, and non-profit co-operative units, and 20,000 purpose-built rental units. The goal is to retain income and household diversity, prioritize rental housing, and collaborate with government and non-profit partners to provide housing for low-income households. 50% of the new units are for households earning less than $80,000 per year, and 40% are family-size units.\n",

The Vancouver Plan (2022) was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and will guide the City's long-term growth over the next 30 years. Implementation planning work will follow over the next two to four years. The site is located within the Cambie Corridor Plan, which is generally aligned with the Vancouver Plan.\n\n2. The site is located within the Queen Elizabeth neighborhood of the Cambie Corridor Plan. The Plan supports residential buildings up to six stories in height for this site, with a suggested density range of 2.0-2.5 FSR. The development potential for each site falls within, below, or above this range based on site-specific urban design and public realm performance. Buildings are expected to have front doors to the street and activate adjacent lanes. The Plan also allows for consideration of an additional partial storey for common rooftop indoor amenity spaces if contiguous with the outdoor amenity space.\n\n3. On April 27, 2022, Council resolved to receive a Housing Needs Report (HNR) prepared by staff. The HNR is required by the BC Provincial government and must be considered by Council when developing or amending a development plan in relation to affordable housing, rental housing, and special needs housing.\n",

REPORT: Background/Context. 1. Site and Context. The subject site (see Figure 1) is comprised of one legal parcel fronting Hull Street. The total site area is approximately 396.8 sq. m (4,271 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 10.7 m (35 ft.) along Hull Street and a depth of 37.2 m (122 ft.). Figure 1: Location Map – Site and Context. The surrounding area includes properties zoned for single and multiple dwelling uses under RS and RT District Schedules. In addition, there are a number of CD-1 zones that allow for a variety of uses including seniors supportive housing and mixed-use developments with commercial and residential uses. The site is currently zoned RS-1 and developed with one single-detached home constructed in 1918. The property is not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register. The property contains two rental tenancies and the tenant protection policy does not apply. 2. Policy Context. Vancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan. Secured Rental Policy (“SRP”) – The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations. The SRP outlines the following locational eligibility criteria for sites in low-density areas: • In an existing RS or RT zone outside of recent community plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings); • Located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping; and • On the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road. Sites that meet these criteria and that are part of the typical street grid (including having lane or secondary street access to the rear) and are regular in shape and size are eligible for rezoning to an RR District.\nshape, size, and other attributes may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to new residential rental zones. The applicable options are determined by the site's size, orientation, and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six-storeys may be considered for projects on arterials with a minimum 20% below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria for three-storey buildings under SRP.\n\nIn December 2021, Council approved the addition of new residential rental (\"RR\") zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law: \"RR-1\", \"RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C\", and \"RR-3A and RR-3B\". The RR zones set regulations for permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on development expectations under each RR zone is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines.\n\nThe SRP and RR zones aim to enable incremental change in neighborhoods with detached houses and duplexes. The guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighborliness, social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape with architectural variety and diverse housing options.\n\nIn November 2017, Council approved the Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027). The strategy aims to shift the supply of new homes towards the right supply, with targets for new units across a continuum of housing types. The targets focus on retaining income and household diversity, increasing rental housing production, and coordinating with government and non-profit partners to provide housing for low-income households. The strategy aims for a total of 72,000 new homes in the 10-year period, including 12,000 social, supportive, and non-profit co-operative units, and 20,000 purpose-built rental units. Nearly 50% of the new homes are targeted for rental housing.\n",

Site and Context\nThe subject site is a full block face between West 39th and 40th Avenue. It is currently zoned RS-5 and developed with four single-detached homes. The properties are not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register.\n2. Policy Context\nThe Vancouver Plan and Secured Rental Policy support the rezoning application.\n\nNote: The document has been shortened and joined together for readability.\nRecent community plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings) located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping, and on the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the new residential rental zones. The applicable option or options are further informed by the site's size, orientation, and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six-storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under SRP for six-storey buildings. Along with updates to the SRP, in December 2021 Council approved the addition of new residential rental (\"RR\") zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law: RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C, and RR-3A and RR-3B. The RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines. The guidelines support new missing middle development in neighborhoods that currently consist primarily of detached houses and duplexes.\n",

The amendment would allow for a four storey rental building in accordance with the Secured Rental Policy (“SRP”). A future building design would be submitted through the development permit process and reviewed with the public at that time. Staff have assessed the application and conclude that it meets the intent of the SRP. Staff recommend that the application be referred to a Public Hearing, with the recommendation of the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability to approve it in principle, subject to the Public Hearing, and conditions contained within Appendix B.\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\n• Vancouver Plan (2022)\n• Secured Rental Policy (2012, last amended 2023)\n• RR-2A District Schedule (2022)\n• Residential Rental District Schedules Design Guidelines (2022)\n• Housing Needs Report (2022)\n• Family Room: Housing Mix Policy for Rezoning Projects (2016)\n• High-Density Housing for Families with Children Guidelines (1992, last amended 2022)\n• Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (2010, last amended 2022)\n• Urban Forest Strategy (2014, last amended 2018)\n• Vancouver Development Cost Levy By-law No. 9755\n• Vancouver Utilities Development Cost Levy By-law No. 12183\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site (see Figure 1) is comprised of a single legal parcel fronting West 30th Avenue. The total site area is approximately 1,204.8 sq. m (12,968 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 30.5 m (100 ft.) along West 30th Avenue and a depth of 39.5 m (130 ft.).\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\nThis property and the surrounding area are zoned for residential uses under RS District Schedules with the exception of the C-2 area to the west that allows mixed-use development with commercial and residential uses. The site is currently zoned RS-5 and is being used as a surface parking lot. The property contains no rental tenancies and the tenant protection policy does not apply.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Rezoning: 3581 West 30th Avenue – RTS 15780\nVancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nSecured Rental Policy (“SRP”) – The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations.\nThe SRP outlines the following locational eligibility criteria for sites in low-density areas:\n• In an existing RS or RT zone outside of recent community plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings);\n• Located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping; and\n• On the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road.\nSites that meet these criteria and that are part of the typical street grid (including having lane or secondary street access to the rear) and are regular in shape, size and other attributes may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the new residential rental zones. The applicable option or\nOptions are further informed by the site’s size, orientation, and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six-storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under SRP for four storey buildings.\n\nRR Zoning District Schedules and Design Guidelines – Along with updates to the SRP, in December 2021 Council approved the addition of new residential rental (“RR”) zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law: RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C, and RR-3A and RR-3B. Like other standard zoning districts, the RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed.\n\nFurther direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines. Recognizing that the SRP and RR zones are intended to enable incremental change in neighborhoods that currently consist primarily of detached houses and duplexes, the guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighborliness and social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape which accommodates more architectural variety and diversity of housing options.\n\nHousing Vancouver Strategy – In November 2017, Council approved the Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027). The Strategy seeks to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply, with targets for new units along a continuum of housing types. The Housing Vancouver targets were based on the core goals of retaining the diversity of incomes and households in the city, shifting housing production towards rental to meet the greatest need, and coordinating action with government and non-profit partners to deliver housing for the lowest income households.\n",

Site and Context\nThe subject site (see Figure 1) is comprised of six legal parcels fronting East 41st Avenue. The total site area is approximately 4,515.1 sq. m (48,600 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 91 m (300 ft.) along East 41st Avenue and a depth of 49 m (162 ft.).\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\nThis property and the surrounding area are zoned for residential uses under RS and RT-11 Schedules. There is a residential property zoned CD-1 directly east of the proposed site. The site is currently zoned RS-1 and developed with six single-detached homes constructed between 1970 and 1986. The properties are not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register. The property contains six rental tenancies and the Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy applies.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years.

The specific options depend on the size, orientation, and context of the site. The SRP generally allows for up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on non-arterial sites. Projects on arterials may be considered for up to six-storeys if they include below-market rental housing or social housing. This application complies with the location criteria for five-storey buildings under the SRP. In addition to the SRP, new residential rental zoning district schedules (RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B, RR-2C, RR-3A, and RR-3B) were approved in December 2021. These zones have regulations regarding use, density, and height limits, and all residential uses are secured as rental tenure with no stratification or sale of individual units allowed. The Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines provide further direction on development expectations for each RR zone. The guidelines aim to support new buildings that promote neighborliness, social connection, and architectural variety in neighborhoods primarily consisting of detached houses and duplexes. The Housing Vancouver Strategy, approved in November 2017, aims to increase the supply of new homes.\n",

The proposal is to permit a four-storey and a three-storey residential building with 13 secured rental units. Staff recommend referring the application to a Public Hearing with the recommendation to approve it in principle, subject to conditions.\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\n• Vancouver Plan (2022)\n• Broadway Plan (2022)\n• Policy on Consideration of Rezoning Applications and Heritage Revitalization Agreements during Broadway Planning Process (Broadway Interim Rezoning Policy) (2018)\n• Secured Rental Policy (2012, last amended 2023)\n• Housing Needs Report (2022)\n• Housing Vancouver Strategy (2017)\n• Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy (2019, amended 2023)\n• Family Room: Housing Mix Policy for Rezoning Projects (2016)\n• High-Density Housing for Families with Children Guidelines (1992, last amended 2022)\n• Latecomer Policy (2021)\n• Vancouver Development Cost Levy By-law No. 9755\n• Vancouver Utilities Development Cost Levy By-law No. 12183\n• Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (2010, amended 2022)\n• Urban Forest Strategy (2016)\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\nSite and Context\nThe subject site is located midblock on West 16th Avenue between Yukon and Alberta Streets. The site area is approximately 597.6 sq. m (6,432 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 15.2 m (50 ft.) along 16th Avenue and a depth of 39.3 m (129 ft.).\nThis property and the surrounding area are zoned for residential uses under the RT-5 District. The site is developed with a previously converted single-family residential dwelling with four rental units. Surrounding properties are developed with two-storey residential buildings.\nNeighbourhood Amenities\n- Public Parks: Lilian To, Mount Pleasant, Heather, Douglas, and Grimmett.\n- Community Spaces: Heritage Hall and Douglas Park Community Centre.\n- Childcare Facilities: Our House, Les Petits Artistes Montessori Centre, Cambie Montessori, and Acorn-Eight Oaks.\nLocal School Capacity\n- The site is located within the catchment area of Fraser Elementary School and Hamber Secondary School. Fraser Elementary is currently operating at 190% of capacity and is forecasted to be operating at 176% capacity by 2031. Hamber Secondary is operating under capacity with an expected capacity of 79% by 2031.\nPolicy Context\nVancouver Plan - The Vancouver Plan is a land use strategy approved by Council to guide long-term growth. The site is located within the Broadway Plan.\nBroadway Plan - The Broadway Plan is in alignment with the Vancouver Plan.\n\nThe Council approved a comprehensive community plan for the area from Vine Street to Clark Drive and 1st Avenue to 16th Avenue on June 22, 2022. The plan focuses on integrating new housing, jobs, and amenities around the new Broadway Subway. This application was submitted before the plan was approved but is being considered under the Broadway Plan.\n\nIn 2018, the Council endorsed the Broadway Interim Rezoning Policy, which allowed specific rezoning proposals to proceed during the planning process for the Broadway Plan. This application applied and qualified under this provision, along with the Secured Rental Policy.\n\nOn November 26, 2019, the Council approved amendments to the Secured Market Rental Housing Policy, renaming it the Secured Rental Policy. Further amendments were adopted on December 14, 2021, to facilitate the delivery of secured rental units. These changes allow certain sites on arterials adjacent to large commercial areas to rezone to a new rental tenure district schedule.\n\nThis application met the deadlines to be considered under the 2019 Secured Rental Policy but does not comply with the current policy as the site is now located in a community plan area.\n",

The rezoning would allow for a four-storey rental building in accordance with the Secured Rental Policy. Staff recommend referring the application to a Public Hearing with the recommendation to approve it in principle, subject to conditions.\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\n- Vancouver Plan (2022)\n- Secured Rental Policy (2012, last amended 2023)\n- RR-2A District Schedule (2022)\n- Residential Rental District Schedules Design Guidelines (2022)\n- Housing Needs Report (2022)\n- Family Room: Housing Mix Policy for Rezoning Projects (2016)\n- High-Density Housing for Families with Children Guidelines (1992, last amended 2022)\n- Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy (2019)\n- Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (2010, last amended 2022)\n- Urban Forest Strategy (2014, amended 2018)\n- Vancouver Development Cost Levy By-law No. 9755\n- Vancouver Utilities Development Cost Levy By-law No. 12183\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site is comprised of two legal parcels on Trafalgar Street. The total site area is approximately 882.4 sq. m (9,498 sq. ft.) with a frontage of 38.2 m (125 ft.) and a depth of 23.1 m (76 ft.).\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan - A long-term land use strategy approved by Council in 2022.\nSecured Rental Policy - Encourages the construction of new rental housing in Vancouver.\n\nThe applicable option or options are further informed by the site’s size, orientation, and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under SRP for four-storey buildings.\n\nRR Zoning District Schedules and Design Guidelines – Along with updates to the SRP, in December 2021 Council approved the addition of new residential rental (“RR”) zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law: “RR-1”, “RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C”, and “RR-3A and RR-3B”. Like other standard zoning districts, the RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines.\n\nRecognizing that the SRP and RR zones are intended to enable incremental change in neighborhoods that currently consist primarily of detached houses and duplexes, the guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighborliness and social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape which accommodates more architectural variety and diversity of housing options.\n\nHousing Vancouver Strategy – In November 2017, Council approved the Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027). The strategy seeks to shift the supply of new homes toward the right.\n",

The proposed amendment would rezone the properties from RS-1 (Residential) District to RM-8A (Residential) District to allow for a townhouse or rowhouse development. The maximum floor space ratio (FSR) for RM-8A can be up to 1.20. The application meets the intent of the Cambie Corridor Plan. Staff recommend that the application be referred to a Public Hearing, with the recommendation of the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability to approve it in principle, subject to the Public Hearing, and conditions contained within Appendix B.\n\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\n• Vancouver Plan (2022)\n• Cambie Corridor Plan and Cambie Corridor Public Realm Plan (2018)\n• RM-8, RM-8A, RM-8N and RM-8AN Districts Schedule (2018, amended 2023)\n• RM-8A and RM-8AN Guidelines (2018, amended 2023)\n• Housing Needs Report (2022)\n• Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy (2019, amended 2023)\n• Density Bonus Contributions (2014, amended 2023)\n• Vancouver Utilities Development Cost Levy By-law No. 12183\n• Development Cost Levy By-law No. 9755\n• Latecomer Policy (2021)\n• Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (2010, amended 2022)\n• Urban Forest Strategy (2014)\n\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site at 6333-6369 Yukon Street is comprised of three legal parcels with single dwellings along Yukon Street, one block east of Cambie Street, between West 46th Avenue and West 48th Avenue. The site area is approximately 2,298 sq. m (24,736 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 49.4 m (162 ft.) along Yukon Street and a depth of 46.9 m (154 ft.).\nThe site and surrounding areas to the north, east and south are zoned RS-1 and the site is developed with three single-detached homes. To the west of the site, along Cambie Street, is a mixture of CD-1, RT-1 and RT-2 developments. The site is eligible for rezoning to RM-8A under the Cambie Corridor Plan. The Langara 49th Avenue Canada Line Station is one block away and Tisdall Park and the 45th Avenue Bikeway are approximately two blocks away.\nThe houses were constructed in 1950 and 1989 and are not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register. The property contains two rental tenancies and tenant protection applies.\n\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The site is located within the Cambie Corridor Plan which is generally in alignment with the Vancouver Plan.\nCambie Corridor Plan (“the Plan”) – The Plan guides the transformation of the Corridor into an area where people can live, work, shop, play and learn – all within close proximity to the Canada Line. The Corridor’s population is anticipated to double by 2041, with 30,000 new homes, making it one of the largest growth areas outside of downtown.\nThe Plan identifies over 1,100 detached lots as eligible to redevelop for townhouses, creating opportunities for approximately 8,200 units of much-needed ground-oriented housing. Specifically, Section 4.3.12 of the Plan supports residential townhouses or rowhouses for up to three storeys and a maximum density of 1.20 FSR. The City has recently approved a second phase of City-initiated rezoning to RM-8A within the Cambie Corridor, however this site is not included within that area and requires a simplified rezoning to RM-8A.\nThe site is located within the Oakridge neighbourhood, which is a regionally designated Municipal Town Centre. This area is expected to evolve over time to become an urban hub with increased residential density, job space and shops and services to support an active street life. For off-arterial locations, which includes the subject site, a variety of new housing types and tenures are expected to allow more people to live in this area. The intent for this neighbourhood is to introduce family-friendly, ground-oriented housing in the form of townhouses or rowhouses. This will provide needed housing options.\nTransitions from taller buildings on Cambie Street to adjacent lower-density areas are guided by clear design guidelines. These guidelines establish expectations for development form, typologies, family housing requirements, sunlight access, privacy, landscape treatment, and flexible options for smaller lots. See Figure 2 for the form of development according to the design guidelines, which include courtyard rowhouses on the left and multiple unit stacked townhouses on the right.\n",

The application meets the Secured Rental Policy and should be referred to a Public Hearing.\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\nRelevant Council policies include the Vancouver Plan, Secured Rental Policy, RR-2B District Schedule, Rental District Schedules Design Guidelines, Housing Vancouver Strategy, Housing Needs Report, Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy, Family Room: Housing Mix Policy for Rezoning Projects, High-Density Housing for Families with Children Guidelines, Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings, Urban Forest Strategy, Latecomer Policy, Vancouver Development Cost Levy By-law, and Vancouver Utilities Development Cost Levy By-law.\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site at 2753-2769 East 49th Avenue consists of three parcels with a total area of approximately 2,353 sq. m. The site is currently zoned RS-1 and contains three single-detached homes.\n2. Policy Context\nThe Vancouver Plan, Secured Rental Policy, and other relevant policies support the rezoning application.\n\nBuildings and multiple conversion dwellings located near public transit and local shopping, on the first full block of an eligible arterial road, may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to new residential rental zones. The applicable options are determined by the site's size, orientation, and adjacent context. The SRP generally allows up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six-storeys may be considered for projects on arterials with below-market rental housing or social housing. This application complies with the location criteria for five-storey buildings under SRP. In December 2021, Council approved the addition of new residential rental zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law: RR-1, RR-2A, RR-2B, RR-2C, RR-3A, and RR-3B. The RR zones set regulations for use, density, and height limits, with all residential uses secured as rental tenure and no stratification or sale of individual units allowed. The Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines provide further direction on development expectations for each RR zone, supporting new missing middle buildings that foster neighbourliness, social connection, and architectural variety in evolving neighbourhoods.\n",

The proposed amendment would rezone the properties from RS-5 (Residential) District to RM-8AN (Residential) District to allow for a townhouse or rowhouse development. The maximum floor space ratio (FSR) for RM-8AN is 1.20 and can generate approximately six to eight townhouse units on one 50 ft.-wide lot.\nThe application meets the intent of the Cambie Corridor Plan (the “Plan”). Staff recommend that the application be referred to a Public Hearing, with the recommendation of the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability to approve it in principle, subject to the Public Hearing, and conditions contained within Appendix B.\nCOUNCIL AUTHORITY/PREVIOUS DECISIONS\n• Vancouver Plan (2022)\n• Cambie Corridor Plan and Cambie Corridor Public Realm Plan (2018)\n• RM-8, RM-8A, RM-8N and RM-8AN Districts Schedule and Guidelines (2018, amended 2023)\n• Housing Needs Report (2022)\n• Density Bonus Contributions (2014, amended 2023)\n• Vancouver Development Cost Levy By-Law No. 9755\n• Utilities Development Cost Levy By-law No. 12183\n• Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (2010, amended 2022)\n• Latecomer Policy (2021)\n• Urban Forest Strategy (2014)\nRezoning: 4721 Oak Street – RTS 15910\nREPORT\nBackground/Context\n1. Site and Context\nThe subject site at 4721 Oak Street (see Figure 1) is comprised of one legal parcel along Oak Street, south of Connaught Drive. The site area is approximately 553.5 sq. m (5,958 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 15.1 m (49.7 ft.) along Oak Street and a depth of 37.6 m (120 ft.).\nThe surrounding areas are zoned RS-5 and RS-1 and developed with single-detached homes. BC Children’s Hospital, zoned CD-1, is northwest of the site. The area along Oak Street is eligible for rezoning to RM-8AN under the Plan.\nThe site contains one house, constructed in 1926 and is not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register. The property contains no rental tenancies and tenant protection does not apply.\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land-use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The site is located within the Plan which is in alignment with the Vancouver Plan.\nCambie Corridor Plan – The Plan guides the transformation of the Corridor into an area where people can live, work, shop, play and learn – all within close proximity to the Canada Line. The Corridor’s population is anticipated to double by 2041, with 30,000 new homes, making it one of the largest growth areas outside of downtown. The subject site is located within the Queen Elizabeth neighbourhood, characterized by its existing low-density residential character and green park-like setting.\nThe Plan identifies over 1,100 detached lots as eligible to redevelop for townhouses, creating opportunities for approximately 8,200 units of much-needed ground-oriented housing. Specifically, Section 4.2.9 of the Plan supports residential townhouses or rowhouses for up to three storeys and a maximum density of 1.20 FSR.\nDesign Guidelines – The RM-8A/AN District Schedules are accompanied by clear design guidelines. These guidelines establish form of development expectations which provide predictability and certainty for new buildings. Design criteria sets out expected typologies, requirements for family housing, access to sunlight, privacy, landscape treatment, along with flexible development options for smaller lots (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Form of Development per the Design Guidelines – (Courtyard Rowhouses (Left) and Multiple Unit Stacked Townhouses (Right)\nFurther, the RM-8AN District requires more robust noise mitigation measures for buildings that are located along arterial streets, whereas the RM-8A does not, since RM-8A sites are not facing arterials. Since 49th Avenue is classified as an arterial street, the proposed rezoning is to the RM-8AN District Schedule.\nHousing Needs Report (2022) – On April 27, 2022, Council resolved at a public meeting to receive a Housing Needs Report (HNR) prepared by staff. Further to the BC Provincial government’s requirement, Council must consider the most recent HNR when making decisions on housing policies and projects. The HNR provides an analysis of the City’s housing needs and identifies strategies to address those needs. The HNR supports the proposed rezoning as it contributes to the City’s housing supply and diversity.\nRECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that the rezoning application for 4721 Oak Street be referred to a Public Hearing, with the recommendation of the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability to approve it in principle, subject to the Public Hearing, and conditions contained within Appendix B.\nDeveloping a development plan or amending a development plan in relation to Council's housing policies for affordable housing, rental housing, and special needs housing. This zoning amendment would facilitate the delivery of strata housing and is supported by data and findings within the HNR. The rezoning process to an RM-8A/AN follows a simplified process. Architectural drawings are not required at the rezoning stage, and the review is limited to a plan amendment to designate the site from RS-5 to RM-AN.\n",

The amendment would allow for a five-storey rental building in accordance with the Secured Rental Policy (“SRP”). An estimated total of 30 secured rental units would be delivered through this application. A future building design would be submitted through the development permit process and reviewed with the public at that time.

Site and Context\nThe subject site (see Figure 1) is comprised of one legal parcel fronting Dunbar Street. The total site area is approximately 1,002.8 sq. m (10,800 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 24.4 m (80 ft.) along Dunbar Street and a depth of 41.1 m (135 ft.).\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\nThis property and the surrounding area are zoned for residential uses under RS District Schedules with a CD-1 directly adjacent that is being used for residential rental purposes. There is a pedestrian path directly north of the site connecting Dunbar Street and Collingwood Place. The site is currently zoned RS-5 and developed with a single-detached home constructed in 1955. The property is not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nSecured Rental Policy (“SRP”) – The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations. The SRP outlines the following locational eligibility criteria for sites in low-density areas:\n• In an existing RS or RT zone outside of recent community plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings);\n• Located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping; and\n• On the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road.\nSites that meet these criteria and that are part of the typical street grid, and have a full lane to the rear or are double-fronting may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the Residential Rental zones. In addition, the SRP considers the shape, size and\nThe SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under SRP for five-storey buildings.\n\nIn December 2021, Council approved the addition of new residential rental (\"RR\") zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law: \"RR-1\", \"RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C\", and \"RR-3A and RR-3B\". The RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines.\n\nThe Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027) seeks to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply, with targets for new units along a continuum of housing types. Overall, 72,000 new homes are targeted for the 10-year period, including 12,000 social, supportive and non-profit co-operative units and 20,000 purpose-built rental units. Nearly 50% of the new units are to serve households earning less than $80,000 per year, and 40% are to be family-size units.\n",

Site and Context\nThe subject site (see Figure 1) is comprised of three legal parcels fronting Victoria Drive and East 39th Avenue. The site area is approximately 1,579.4 sq. m (17,000 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 43.2 m (142 ft.) on Victoria Drive and a depth of 36.8 m (121 ft.) on East 39th Ave. This corner site is abutting two lanes to the south and east.\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\nThe site is zoned for low density multiple dwelling developments under the RT-2 District Schedule. To the east of the site are RS-1 zoned single detached houses. In all other directions, the site is surrounded by C-2 zoned properties that permit six-storey mixed-use rental buildings. The property south of the lane, at the end of the block, is zoned CD-1 and permits a six-storey mixed-use rental building with 30% of units occupied by low income households. The site is currently developed with three single detached houses constructed in the 1940s, which are not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register. The site has seven rental tenancies and the Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy applies.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nSecured Rental Policy (“SRP”) – The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations. The SRP outlines the following locational eligibility criteria for sites in\nlow-density areas: In an existing RS or RT zone outside of recent community plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings); Located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping; and On the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road. Sites that meet these criteria and that are part of the typical street grid (including having lane or secondary street access to the rear) and are regular in shape, size and other attributes may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the new residential rental zones. The applicable option or options are further informed by the site’s size, orientation and adjacent context. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with location criteria under the SRP for six-storey buildings. RR Zoning District Schedules and Design Guidelines – Along with updates to the SRP, in December 2021 Council approved the addition of three new residential rental (“RR”) zoning district schedules to the Zoning and Development By-law: “RR-1”, “RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C”, and “RR-3A and RR-3B”. Like other standard zoning districts, the RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines. Recognizing that the SRP and RR zones are intended to enable incremental change in neighbourhoods that currently consist primarily of detached houses and duplexes, the guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighbourliness and social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape which accommodates more architectural variety and diversity of housing options. Housing Vancouver Strategy – In November 2017, Council approved the Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027). The strategy seeks to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply, with targets for new units along a continuum of housing types. The Housing Vancouver\n",

    "text": "August 29, 2023, Casey Peters contacted Vancouver City Council regarding the rezoning application for 6065-6075 Collingwood Place. The recommendation is to refer the application to a Public Hearing along with the recommendations of the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability. The rezoning application is to change the lands from RS-5 District to RR-2B District. The recommendation also includes the preparation of necessary by-laws and amendments to the Subdivision By-law. The report concludes that the application meets the intent of the Secured Rental Policy and recommends its approval in principle, subject to the Public Hearing and conditions outlined in Appendix B. The policy context includes the Vancouver Plan and the Secured Rental Policy. The subject site is comprised of two legal parcels with a total area of approximately 2,443.4 sq. m. The site is currently zoned RS-5 and developed with two single-detached homes. The proposal aligns with the priorities of the Housing Vancouver Strategy.\nThe first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road is considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the Residential Rental zones. The SRP also considers the shape, size, and other attributes of the site in determining eligibility. Rezoning to a Residential Rental zone is supported on sites where a typical building shape as generally allowed in the applicable zones can be accommodated. The SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under SRP for five-storey buildings.\n\nIn December 2021, Council approved the addition of new residential rental (\"RR\") zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law: \"RR-1\", \"RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C\", and \"RR-3A and RR-3B\". The RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines.\n\nThe SRP and RR zones are intended to enable incremental change in neighborhoods that currently consist primarily of detached houses and duplexes. The guidelines support new missing middle buildings that foster neighborliness and social connection, and contribute to an evolving streetscape which accommodates more architectural variety and diversity of housing options.\n\nIn November 2017, Council approved the Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027). The strategy seeks to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply, with targets for new units along a continuum of housing types. The Housing Vancouver targets were based on the core goals of retaining the diversity of incomes and households in the area.\n",

Site and Context\nThe subject site is located on the southwest corner of Granville Street and West 71st Avenue. It consists of a three-lot assembly with a commercial building and a two-storey rental building. The surrounding area is undergoing significant change. Rezoning has been approved for nearby developments.\nGeorge Elementary School, Magee and Sir Winston Churchill Secondary Schools have utilization rates of 96%, 77%, and 98% respectively in 2021. By 2031, George Elementary School's utilization rate is expected to remain the same, while Magee and Sir Winston Churchill Secondary Schools will have utilization rates of 75% and 93% respectively. The Vancouver School Board will explore options to reduce pressure on schools in the area and work with City staff to plan for future growth. The Vancouver Plan, approved in July 2022, is a long-term land-use strategy for the City. The Marpole Community Plan aligns with the Vancouver Plan. Council must consider the most recent Housing Needs Report when preparing or amending a development plan related to affordable housing, rental housing, and special needs housing. If approved, this rezoning application would facilitate the delivery of secured-rental housing and address the findings within the Housing Needs Report.\n",

Site and Context\nThe subject site (see Figure 1) is comprised of two legal parcels fronting West 16th Avenue. The total site area is approximately 1,166.6 sq. m (12,557 sq. ft.), with a frontage of 34.7 m (114 ft.) along West 16th Avenue and a depth of 33.5 m (110 ft.).\nFigure 1: Location Map – Site and Context\nThis property and the surrounding area are zoned for residential uses under RT and R1-1 District Schedules with the exception of the C-1 area to the north and west that allows mixed-use developments. The site is currently zoned RT-2 and developed with two single-detached homes constructed in 1943. The properties are not listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register. The property contains seven rental tenancies and the tenant protection policy does apply.\n2. Policy Context\nVancouver Plan – The Vancouver Plan was approved by Council on July 22, 2022 and is a land use strategy to guide long-term growth of the City over the next 30 years. The approved Vancouver Plan will serve as a framework with further implementation planning work to follow over the next two to four years. The proposal addresses priorities within the Housing Vancouver Strategy which aligns with the Vancouver Plan.\nSecured Rental Policy (“SRP”) – The SRP encourages the construction of new purpose-built rental housing in Vancouver. Updates to the SRP were approved by Council in December 2021 to streamline the delivery of new rental housing. These included clarifying opportunities for rezoning in low-density areas close to public transit, shopping and other daily needs, and to streamline and simplify the rezoning process by utilizing new rental zones with standardized regulations. The SRP outlines the following locational eligibility criteria for sites in low-density areas:\n• In an existing R1-1 or RT zone outside of recent community plan areas (excluding certain RT-zoned areas in Kitsilano and Kensington-Cedar Cottage with high proportions of heritage buildings and multiple conversion dwellings);\n• Located within close proximity to public transit and local shopping; and\n• On the first full block on either side of an eligible arterial road.\nSites that meet these criteria and that are part of the typical street grid (including having lane or secondary street access to the rear) and are regular in shape, size and other attributes may be considered for rezoning under the SRP to one of the residential rental zones. The applicable option or options are further informed by the site’s size.\nThe SRP generally supports up to four-storey mixed-use and five-storey residential apartments on arterials, and up to four-storey townhouses or apartments on sites off arterials. Up to six storeys may be considered for projects on arterials where the residential component includes a minimum 20% permanently secured below-market rental housing or 100% social housing. This application complies with the location criteria under SRP for five-storey buildings.\n\nIn December 2021, Council approved the addition of new residential rental (\"RR\") zoning district schedules to the Zoning & Development By-law: \"RR-1\", \"RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C\", and \"RR-3A and RR-3B\". The RR zones set basic regulations such as permitted use, density, and height limits, while allowing for a range of building designs. All residential uses in the RR zones are secured as rental tenure, and no stratification or sale of individual residential units is allowed. Further direction on form of development expectations under each of the RR zones is provided in the Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines.\n\nThe Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027) seeks to shift the supply of new homes toward the right supply, with targets for new units along a continuum of housing types. Overall, 72,000 new homes are targeted for the 10-year period, including 12,000 social, supportive and non-profit co-operative units and 20,000 purpose-built rental units. Nearly 50% of the new units are to serve households earning less than $80,000 per year, and 40% are to be family-size units.\n\nOn April 27th, 2022, Council resolved to receive a Housing Needs Report (HNR) prepared by staff. Council must consider their most recent HNR when developing a plan.\n",

The Granville Street Planning process supports the entertainment and economic nature of Granville Street and Vancouver's tourism sector, including expanding hotel use in the Study Area. The proposal for 1002-1052 Seymour Street and 550 Nelson Street aligns with these objectives.\n\nThe Metro Core Jobs and Economy Land Use Plan (2007) identifies zoning and policy changes to address a job space shortfall and meet Vancouver's 30-year economic growth targets. Downtown South is designated as an area for support services, including hotels, close to the Central Business District (CBD).\n\nThe Employment Lands and Economy Review (2020) analyzed Vancouver's economy, projected future changes, and the city's capacity to accommodate job growth under existing policy and zoning.

(Director: Ajit Thaliwal) has applied to the City of Richmond for permission to develop eight townhouse units at 6571 and 6591 No. 1 Road on a site zoned \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\". The site currently contains one single-family dwelling (on 6591 No 1 Road).\n\nThe site is being rezoned from \"Single Detached (RS 1/F)\" to \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\" for this project under Bylaw 10288 (RZ 16-731275).\n\nA Servicing Agreement is required as a condition of rezoning and includes, but is not limited to, the following improvements:\n- Permanent closure of the existing southerly driveway (at 6591 No. 1 Road)\n- Installation of new water, storm and sanitary service connections.\n\nDevelopment Information:\nPlease refer to attached Development Application Data Sheet (Attachment 1) for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements.\n\nBackground:\nDevelopment surrounding the subject site is as follows:\n- To the north: A single detached dwelling on property designated for arterial road townhouse development in the Official Community Plan (OCP) and zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/F)\".\n- To the east: Across from No. 1 Road, single detached dwellings, designated for single detached development in the OCP and zoned \"Single Detached (RS2/C)\".\n- To the south: A three-storey townhouse complex zoned \"Town Housing (ZT27)-Robson Drive/Court (Terra Nova)\".\n- To the west: A three-storey townhouse complex zoned \"Town Housing (ZT27)-Robson Drive/Court (Terra Nova)\".\n\nRezoning and Public Hearing Results:\nDuring the rezoning process, staff identified the following design issues to be resolved at the Development Permit stage:\n- Compliance with Development Permit Guidelines for the form and character of multiple-family projects provided in the OCP.\n- Refinement of landscape design, fencing and interface with abutting lots.\n- Review of retaining wall heights and requirements for guardrails.\n- Further assessment of the potential relocation of the front yard hedge.\n- Refinement of the outdoor amenity area design, including the choice of play equipment.\n- Review of relevant accessibility features for the proposed convertible unit and aging-in-place design features in all units.\n- Review of a sustainability strategy for the development proposal and ensuring that the development meets or exceeds the City's required Energy Step Code for Part 9 construction applicable at time of construction.\n\nThe Public Hearing for the rezoning of this site was held on March 21, 2022. No public correspondence was received at the Public Hearing.\n\nStaff worked with the applicant to address the above issues in the following ways:\n- Detailed architectural and landscape plans have been provided to demonstrate that the proposed development is generally consistent with the Development Permit guidelines for multi-family projects and Arterial Road Guidelines for Townhouses in the OCP.\n- Detailed landscape plans have been submitted and provide a mix of coniferous and deciduous replacement trees, which meet the bylaw size requirements.\n- The applicant has refined the design of the retaining wall and has provided handrails for the proposed steps by the southwest corner of the site as per BC Building Code requirements.\n- The hedge on-site is proposed to be relocated to the rear of the site and integrated as part of the landscaping.\n- The design of the outdoor amenity area for this townhouse development includes a children's play structure and a bench for parental interaction and to promote social interaction surrounded by landscaping.\n- The proposed accessibility features include aging-in-place features in all units and one convertible unit.\n- The applicant has provided a sustainability strategy and a letter from a Certified Energy Advisor indicating that the project will achieve Step 3 of the BC Energy Step Code with Low Carbon Emission Systems, consistent with current City regulations.\n\nStaff Comments:\nThe proposed scheme attached to this report has satisfactorily addressed the significant urban design issues and other staff comments identified as part of the review of the subject Development Permit application (Plans #1 to #20). In addition, it complies with the intent of the applicable sections of the Official Community Plan and is generally in compliance with the \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\" zone, except for the zoning variance noted below.\n\nZoning Compliance Variance (staff comments in bold):\nThe applicant requests to vary the provisions of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 to reduce the minimum lot width from 50.0 m to 40.2 m. Staff supports the proposed variance as the proposal is generally consistent with the guiding principles of the Arterial Road Land Use Policy and guidelines. The need for this variance was identified in the rezoning staff report and no concerns were raised during the Public Hearing at rezoning stage. The applicant was unable to acquire the adjacent site to the north to increase the lot width as the owner advised they were not interested in selling.\n",

The existing office building is to remain on a new lot on the east portion of the subject site (Lot 2). This proposal aligns with the City's objectives of intensifying existing industrial lands. A location map of the subject site is provided in Attachment 1. A survey of the subject site showing the proposed subdivision plan is provided in Attachment 2. This proposal also involves landscaped restoration within the existing Riparian Management Area (RMA) along the south side of the existing site, as well as improvements to pedestrian circulation and landscaping within the surface parking area on Lot 2. Concurrent with this DP application, there is an application to subdivide the subject site into two lots under the existing Zl3 zone, which must be approved prior to DP issuance (SD 22-025862). A Servicing Agreement (SA) to design and construct the following improvements is required prior to Building Permit issuance, including (but not limited to):\n• Upgrading the existing watermain along the Sparwood Place frontage to meet the minimum required fire flow and fulfill the distance requirement between hydrant and the proposed building.\n• Upgrading approximately 85 m (278 ft.) of the storm sewer along the Wireless Way frontage.\n• The water, storm and sanitary service connections.\nDevelopment Information\nPlease refer to attached Development Application Data Sheet for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements (Attachment 3).\nExisting Site and Surrounding Context\nThe subject site is located on the south side of Wireless Way between No. 6 Road and Knight Street. The site is approximately 20,090 m2 (216,246 ft2) in area and currently contains an existing office building as well as a large surface parking area, with vehicle access from both Wireless Way and Sparwood Place. The subject site is proposed to be subdivided into two new lots of approximately 3,861 m2 (41,548 ft2) in area (Lot 1) and 16,227 m2 (174,698 ft2) in area (Lot 2).\n7451673 December 18, 2023 - 3 -\nDP 21-943418\nExisting development immediately surrounding the subject site is as follows:\n• To the North: Immediately across Wireless Way: light industrial and office buildings on lots zoned \"Industrial Business Park (IB1)\" and \"Industrial Business Park (ZI3) - Crestwood Area (East Cambie)\" at 13351 and 13353 Commerce Parkway and 13811 and 13911 Wireless Way, respectively.\n• To the East: Fronting No. 6 Road: Light industrial and office buildings on lots zoned \"Industrial Business Park (IB1)\" at 13931 Sparwood Place and 5871 No. 6 Road; Richmond Fire-Rescue's No. 7 Fireball on a lot zoned \"School & Institutional Use (SI)\" at 5731 No. 6 Road; and a surface parking lot on a lot zoned \"Industrial Business Park (ZI3) - Crestwood Area (East Cambie)\" at 5611 No. 6 Road.\n• To the South: Single-family dwellings and agricultural uses on lots zoned \"Agriculture (AG1)\" on the south side of Westminster Highway at 13560 to 13720 Westminster Highway.\n• To the West: Light industrial and office buildings on a lot zoned \"Industrial Business Park (IB1)\" at 13880 Wireless Way.\nPublic input during the DP Application Review Process\nStaff has not received any comments from the public in response to the placement of the DP Application Notification Sign on the subject site.\nStaff Comments\nThe proposed scheme attached to this report (Plans #1 to #4.C and Reference Plans) has satisfactorily addressed the significant urban design issues and other staff comments identified as part of the review of the subject DP application. In addition, it complies with the intent of the applicable sections of the Official Community Plan and is generally in compliance with the ZI3 zone, with the exception of the zoning variances noted below.\nZoning Compliance/Variances (staff comments in bold italics)\nThe Applicant requests to vary the provisions of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 to:\n1) Reduce the required number of parking spaces from 2.8 spaces to 0.75 spaces for each 100.0 m2 of gross leasable floor area of building on Lot 1.\nThe site-specific parking rate of 2.8 spaces per 100.0 m2 of gross leasable floor area of building was established with the rezoning of the site to the ZI3 zone in 2004. In 2021, the City's Zoning Bylaw was amended to include reduced parking requirements for industrial uses of 0.75 spaces per 100 m2 of gross leasable floor area. The requested variance to provide 0.75 spaces for each 100.0 m2 of gross leasable floor area of building on Lot 1 reflects the intended use of Lot 1 and is consistent with current standard parking requirements for the \"Industrial, general\" use that specified in the current Zoning Bylaw. The Applicant has proposed Transportation Demand Management (TDM) measures to support the requested variance, including an employee shuttle service between the subject site and the Bridgeport Canada Line station during peak hours, and a subsidized monthly transit pass program to Lot 1 employees, which will run for three years. 7451673\n",

Permit the construction of 16 townhouse units at 4571, 4591, and 4611/4631 Steveston Highway on a site zoned \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\".\n2. Vary the provisions of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 to reduce the front yard setback along Steveston Highway from 6.0 m to 4.50 m.\n\nWayne Craig\nDirector, Development\n(604-247-4625)\n\nStaff Report\n\nOrigin: DP 20-919145\n\nJonathan King (on behalf of Gurpreet Mann, director of 0780012 BC Ltd., Jonathan King and Sandra Rotholc-King, directors of 2517294 Ontario Inc., Azim Bhimani, director of Luxor Homes & Developments Ltd., Gurpreet Mann and Narinder Mann) has applied to the City of Richmond for permission to develop 16 townhouse units at 4571, 4591, and 4611/4631 Steveston Highway. One of the townhouse units is proposed to contain a ground-level secondary suite.\n\nThe site is being rezoned from \"Single Detached (RSl/E)\" and \"Two-Unit Dwellings (RDl)\" zones to the \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\" zone for this project under Bylaw 10081 (RZ 18-839945), which is currently at third reading.\n\nA Servicing Agreement is required as a condition of Building Permit issuance and includes, but is not limited to, the following improvements:\n- Removal of existing sidewalk and replacement with a new 1.5 m concrete sidewalk at the property line and minimum 1.5 m wide landscaped boulevard with street trees behind the existing curb.\n- Removal of the existing driveway crossings and replacement with the frontage works described above.\n- Construction of a new driveway crossing designed to provide \"right in, right out\" access to the site.\n\nDevelopment Information\n\nPlease refer to attached Development Application Data Sheet (Attachment 1) for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements.\n\nBackground\n\nDevelopment surrounding the subject site is as follows:\n- To the north: Single-family dwellings fronting Bonavista Drive on lots zoned \"Single-Detached (RS 1/B).\"\n- To the south: Across Steveston Highway, single-family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single-Detached (RS 1/B)\", which are identified for compact lot coach house development under the Arterial Road Land Use Policy.\n- To the east and west: Single-family dwellings on a lot zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/E)\", which are identified for townhouse development under the Arterial Road Land Use Policy.\n\nRezoning and Public Hearing Results\n\nThe Public Hearing for the rezoning of this site was held on October 21, 2019. No concerns regarding the rezoning application were expressed at the Public Hearing.\n\nStaff Comments\n\nThe proposed scheme attached to this report has satisfactorily addressed the significant urban design issues and other staff comments identified as part of the review of the subject Development Permit application. In addition, it complies with the intent of the applicable sections of the Official Community Plan (OCP) and is generally in compliance with the \"Low Density Townhouse (RTL4)\", except for the zoning variance noted below.\n\nZoning Compliance/Variance (staff comments in bold)\n\nThe applicant requests to vary the provisions of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 to reduce the front yard setback along Steveston Highway from 6.0 m to 4.50 m. Staff supports the proposed variance as it is consistent with the Development Permit Guidelines for Townhouses on arterial roads in the OCP, which support front yard setbacks at 4.5 m (14.8 ft.) where a 6 m (19.7 ft.) rear yard setback to both the ground and second floors of the rear units is provided. The result will provide a wider space between the rear units of the subject development and the single-family dwellings that back onto the subject site. It will also provide a larger buffer to accommodate tree retention along the rear property line. The resulting distance from the back of the curb to the building face would be approximately 8.47 m. The reduced front yard setback does not compromise tree preservation or tree planting opportunities along the site frontage. The proposed architectural design provides appropriate building articulation and interface with neighboring properties. To address the road traffic noise from Steveston Highway, the project acoustical engineer confirmed that the proposed development is designed to meet the interior noise limits as per the CMHC standards. This variance was identified at the rezoning stage, and no concerns were identified at that time.\n\nAdvisory Design Panel Comments\n\nThe Advisory Design Panel (ADP) has reviewed the project and supports it. A copy of the relevant excerpt from the Advisory Design Panel Minutes from Thursday, July 20, 2023 is attached for reference (Attachment 2). The design response from the applicant has been included immediately following the specific Design Panel comments and is identified in 'bold italics'.\n\nAnalysis\n\nConditions of Adjacency\n- The proposed form, massing, and orientation of the buildings are compatible with the existing adjacent developments on the block.\n- While three-storey units are proposed along Steveston Highway, the building height is stepped down to two-storeys along the east property line to provide appropriate transition to the adjacent single-family home.\n- Along the west property line, an entry driveway is being proposed and the three-storey building will be set back 9.42 m from the west property line.\n- Two-storey units in duplex form, as well as the outdoor amenity area, are proposed along the rear (north) property line to minimize privacy and overlook concerns.\n",

A copy of a location map is attached (Attachment 1). The site currently contains one single detached house, which is proposed to be demolished (Attachment 2).\n\nDevelopment Information\n\nPlease refer to the attached Development Application Data Sheet (Attachment 3) for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements.\n\nBackground\n\nDevelopment surrounding the subject site is as follows:\nTo the north: A single detached house on a lot zoned \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (REI)\".\nTo the south: A single detached house on a lot zoned \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (REI)\".\nTo the east: Across Ainsworth Crescent, a single detached house on a lot zoned \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (REI)\".\nTo the west: Across the rear lane, a single detached house on a lot zoned \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (REI)\".\n\nStaff Comments\n\nThe proposed scheme attached to this report has satisfactorily addressed the significant urban design issues and other staff comments identified as part of the review of the subject Development Permit application. In addition, it complies with the intent of the design guidelines for coach houses in the Edgemere neighbourhood contained in the City's Official Community Plan (OCP), and complies with the \"Single Detached with Granny Flat or Coach House - Edgemere (REI)\" zone except the below noted variances.\n\nZoning Compliance/Variances\n\nThe applicant has requested to vary the provisions of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 to:\n1. Increase the maximum setback that a coach house is permitted to be located from the south property line from 2.0 m to 5.95 m.\n2. Decrease the minimum setback that a coach house is permitted to be located from the north property line from 2.0 m to 0.90 m.\n\nThe applicant has requested the above variances in order to locate the coach house safely outside of the tree protection zone of a significant tree (Tree ID# os3 - Douglas Fir, DBH 110 cm) located on the neighbouring property to the south (see Tree Retention and Replacement Plan, Attachment 4). In order to ensure that the entirety of the proposed coach house and garage are located outside of the Tree Protection Zone, while also maintaining consistency with Coach House design guidelines, the applicant proposes to shift the coach house and garage to the north side of the property.\n\nStaff supports the proposed variances as they provide for the retention of a significant tree (a 15 m tall Douglas fir with a diameter of 110 cm) which is in good condition. The City Arborist has reviewed the submitted Arborist Report and supports the efforts taken to shift the proposed coach house and garage as far to the north as possible, such that the development is located entirely outside of the Tree Protection Zone.\n\nThe proposed variances do not interfere with the overall design of the coach house which is generally consistent with the Development Permit guidelines. The applicant has also provided a shadow analysis (Attachment 5) that demonstrates that the variances to the setback requirements in the zone will not result in undue shadowing of the adjacent property to the north.\n\nAnalysis\n\nConditions of Adjacency:\n- The proposed coach house design relates to the proposed single detached housing form, character, and scale of the surrounding neighbourhood.\n- The proposed location of the coach house, which is set back between 1.5 m and 3.0 m from the rear lane, provides an adequate buffer to the adjacent lot to the west.\n- The majority of the floor space in the coach house building is proposed on the ground floor (60 per cent, i.e., entry, powder room, living, kitchen/dining), and the portion of the floor space located in the upper half-storey of the coach house is located in the middle of the overall building.\n- There are no windows proposed on the north or south side elevations to address concerns of overlook into the neighbouring properties. There are windows proposed on the west and east elevations of the coach house to provide passive surveillance of the lane and maximize light penetration.\n\nUrban Design and Site Planning:\n- Consistent with the OCP guidelines for coach houses in the Edgemere neighbourhood, the proposed primary pedestrian entry to the coach house is from the rear lane, and secondary pedestrian access to the coach house is proposed via a pathway from Ainsworth Crescent along the south side of the property.\n- The west elevation of the coach house that faces the lane has been designed as the primary facade, with a main window off the living area at grade, wood posts with stone bases on either side of the covered front porch, as well as exterior wall and landscape lighting to enhance visibility and appearance of the lane as a public space.\n",

Permit the construction of eight townhouse units at 6520 Williams Road on a site zoned \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\"; and 2. Vary the provision of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 to reduce the minimum required lot width from 40.0 m to 36.6 m. Wayne Craig Director of Development WC:mp Att. 2 7049603 May 24, 2023 - 2 - DP 21-936149 Staff Report Origin Gradual Architecture Inc. has applied to the City of Richmond on behalf of Londonpark Holdings Ltd. (Director Long Fei Liu) for permission to develop eight (8) townhouse dwellings at 6520 Williams Road on a site zoned \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\". The site currently contains a single detached dwelling which does not contain a secondary suite. The existing dwelling would be demolished. A location map is provided in Attachment 1. The site is being rezoned from the \"Single Detached (RS 1/E)\" zone to the \"Low Density Townhouses (RTL4)\" zone for this project under Bylaw 10224 (RZ 17-792242). A Servicing Agreement is required as a condition of building permit issuance and includes, but is not limited to, the following improvements: • 0.1 m road dedication along the entire Williams Road frontage; and • Removal of the existing sidewalk and replacement with new 1.5 m concrete sidewalk at the property line, 1.5 m landscaped boulevard with street trees and street lighting, and 0.15 m curb and gutter. Development Information Please refer to attached Development Application Data Sheet (Attachment 2) for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements. Background Development surrounding the subject site is as follows: To the north: Across Williams Rd, a single detached dwelling on a property zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/C)\" with vehicle access from Sheridan Road. To the south and west: Steveston London Secondary School and Park on properties zoned \"School and Institutional Use (SI)\". A single detached dwelling on a property zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/E)\" with vehicle access from Williams Road. This property is part of a separate rezoning application including both the properties at 6560 and 6580 Williams Road (RZ 21-945388), which is currently under staff review. The proposed rezoning would permit development of townhouses with shared vehicle access from the subject site. Rezoning and Public Hearing Results During the rezoning process, staff identified the following design issues to be resolved at the Development Permit stage: • Compliance with Development Permit Guidelines for the form and character of multiple-family projects provided in the Official Community Plan (OCP). 7049603 May 24, 2023 - 3 - DP 21-936149 • Articulation of the west elevations adjacent to the park space to enhance the buildings' appearance and maximize sunlight and views. • Review of the size and species of on-site trees to ensure bylaw compliance and to achieve an acceptable mix of coniferous and deciduous species on-site. • Review of the proposed driveway design and requirement for a vehicle turn-around area, and possibility of retaining Tree #7 if the adjacent site to the east proceeds for redevelopment. • Refinement of the shared outdoor amenity area design, including the choice of play equipment, to create a safe and vibrant environment for children's play and social interaction. • Review the long-term design of the temporary turn-around area, such as future conversion to additional outdoor amenity space. • Review of relevant accessibility features for the one proposed convertible unit and aging-in-place design features in all units. • Review of a sustainability strategy for the development proposal. The Public Hearing for the rezoning of this site was held on February 16, 2021. No public correspondence was received at the Public Hearing. Staff worked with the applicant to address the above design issues in the following ways: • Detailed architectural and landscape plans have been provided to demonstrate that the proposed development is generally consistent with the Development Permit guidelines for multi-family projects and Arterial Road Guidelines for Townhouses in the OCP. • The applicant has refined the design while maintaining the general character presented to Council at the rezoning stage. • The west elevations of the buildings have been modified by providing additional glazing and architectural details to add visual interest and take advantage of the natural sunlight and views to better orient end units to the adjacent park. • Detailed landscape plans have been submitted to provide for a mix of coniferous and deciduous replacement trees, which meet the bylaw size requirements. • The proposed driveway design has been reviewed and approved by the Transportation Department. • The on-site vehicle tum-around area is required for the proposed development as the rezoning application for the proposed townhouse development on the adjacent sites at 6250 and 6280 Williams Road is still under staff review. Tree #7 would be removed to enable the construction of the required vehicle turn-around area. • The design of the outdoor amenity area for this proposal includes two children's play structures and a bench to promote social interaction. • A plan showing details of the conversion of the above-noted on-site tum-around area into expanded outdoor amenity, once the adjacent site access has been developed, is attached the DP. • The proposed accessibility features include aging-in-place features in all units and one convertible unit. • The applicant has provided a sustainability strategy and a letter from a Certified Energy Advisor indicating that the project will achieve Step 3 of the BC Energy Step Code consistent with current City regulations. The above issues are discussed further in the \"Analysis\" section of this report. 7049603\n",

The applicant also proposes to replace two doors on the front (north) elevation and remove the existing overhead garage door on the rear (south) elevation.\n\nThe subject property is split-zoned: most of the site is zoned \"Light Industrial (IL)\", and the small triangular portion along Bayview Street is zoned \"Steveston Commercial (CS2)\". A location map is included in Attachment 1. The subject property is located within the Steveston Village Heritage Conservation Area (SVHCA); it is not one of the identified heritage resources (i.e., protected heritage properties). Both a Heritage Alteration Permit and Development Permit applications were submitted for the proposed exterior changes. However, with recent changes to the Heritage Procedures Bylaw approved by Council on May 15, 2023, only a Development Permit is required for exterior changes to non-heritage properties in the SVHCA. Therefore, the associated Heritage Alteration Permit application is no longer required and the Development Permit application will be used to consider the proposed changes.\n\nDevelopment Information:\nPlease refer to attached Development Application Data Sheet (Attachment 2) for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements.\n\nBackground:\nDevelopment surrounding the subject site is as follows:\nTo the north: Across Bayview Street is a vacant property at 12451 No. 1 Road on a site zoned \"Steveston Commercial (CS2)\". The property is currently landscaped with trees and lawn. The property contains an identified heritage resource, the curved roadway pattern as a trace in the landscape of the original Canadian Pacific Railway track that extended along the waterfront to the Gulf of Georgia Cannery.\nTo the east: Immediately to the east is the south end of No. 1 Road with a pier and boat dock and the No. 1 Road South Discharge station, which is an identified heritage resource.\nTo the south: South Arm Fraser River.\nTo the west: A one-storey, multi-tenant commercial building at 3900 Bayview Street on a site zoned \"Steveston Commercial (CS2)\".\n\n7106166\nMay 24, 2023\n\nDP 21-935984\n\nStaff Comments:\nThe proposed scheme attached to this report has satisfactorily addressed the urban design issues and other staff comments identified as part of the review of the subject Development Permit application. In addition, it is generally in compliance with the \"IL\" zone, with the exception of the zoning variance noted below.\n\nZoning Compliance/Variance:\nThe applicant requests to vary the provision of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 to reduce the minimum front yard setback of 3.0 m from the IL zone boundary to Om to accommodate an enclosure to better screen the existing garbage and recycling containers adjacent to the public sidewalk. The enclosure must comply with the setbacks in the zone.\n\n- In accordance with section 3.2.4 of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500, where a lot is located in more than one zone, siting regulations shall apply as if the zone boundary were a lot line. There is no minimum front yard, side yard, or rear yard setback requirement in the \"Steveston Commercial (CS2)\" zone, but the \"Light Industrial (IL)\" zone requires a minimum of 3.0 m front yard setback.\n- The applicant has noted that the rear yard of the subject site is currently used for a compound by various federal agencies with a security gate to restrict access, so the garbage and recycling containers cannot be located in the rear yard. The proposed location at the northwest corner of the property has been selected to minimize interference with pedestrian traffic and other vehicular access and to ensure compliance with the B.C. Building Code and Richmond Fire Bylaw (e.g. spatial separation requirement).\n- Staff are supportive of this variance request as it allows the enclosure to be constructed to screen the garbage and recycling containers from public view and enhance the overall streetscape along Bayview Street.\n- The front property line is located to the north of the IL zone boundary and is parallel to Bayview Street, so the front yard setback measured from the front property line is greater (2.0 m to the northeast corner of the proposed enclosure).\n- The design of the enclosure has been reviewed as part of the DP application process and will be discussed in detail in the \"Analysis\" section of this report.\n- There are no changes to parking and access to the site as a result of this variance.\n\nRichmond Heritage Commission Comments:\nThe applications were reviewed by the Richmond Heritage Commission (RHC) on April 6, 2022, and the RHC adopted the following resolution:\n\n7106166\nThat the Richmond Heritage Commission support the DP and HAP applications (DP 21-985984 & HA21-985982) for 12551 No. 1 Road subject to a future review of the encroachment issue to ensure the streetscape and urban design is compatible with the Steveston Village Heritage Conservation Area.\n",

A Servicing Agreement is required as a condition of rezoning bylaw adoption and includes, but is not limited to, upgrading approximately 80 m of sanitary sewer on-site and along the shared property line with the properties at 10251, 10271, 10291, and 10311 Dennis Crescent, as well as road improvements involving road dedication and construction of a new treed/grass boulevard at the curb, off-street bike path, and concrete sidewalk along the subject site frontage, and construction of an interim asphalt walkway at the curb from 10300 No. 4 Road to the north end of the block at Wilkinson Road. Development Information: Please refer to attached Development Application Data Sheet for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements (Attachment 2). Background: The subject site is located on the east side of No. 4 Road between Steveston Highway and Wilkinson Road. The site is currently vacant, with five driveway crossings on No. 4 Road. Existing development immediately surrounding the subject site includes single-family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/E)\" fronting No. 4 Road to the north, south, and west, and single-family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/E)\" fronting Dennis Crescent to the east. Rezoning and Public Hearing Results: The Public Hearing for the rezoning of this site was held on June 21, 2021. Although no members of the public were in attendance at the Public Hearing, one letter from a nearby resident was received citing concerns about the proposed change in land use from single-family housing to townhousing and potential traffic and safety concerns. Staff note that the proposed use is consistent with the OCP and Arterial Road Land Use Policy, and the proposed development would have only one access to No 4 Road, thereby reducing the number of vehicle access points along this stretch of roadway. Bylaw 10261 for the rezoning of the subject site was given third reading following the Public Hearing. During the rezoning process, staff identified design issues to be resolved at the Development Permit (DP) stage, including compliance with the DP Guidelines for the form and character of multiple-family projects in the Official Community Plan (OCP), confirmation of interior noise levels and noise mitigation measures, refinement of the landscape design and interface with adjacent single-family housing, refinement of the shared outdoor amenity space design, review of the units that include secondary suites, review of accessibility features, review of a sustainability strategy, ensuring satisfactory plantings within the Statutory Right-of-Way (SRW) for the sanitary sewer, ensuring proposed tree relocations are viable, and accommodation of hedge Hl-H7 if possible. Through the review of this DP application, staff worked with the applicant to address the design issues and ensure consistency with the applicable design guidelines contained within the OCP. The applicant has made revisions to the proposal to address the design issues identified, including revisions to the Landscape Plan, demonstration of functional design for units containing secondary suites, incorporation of relevant accessibility features, refinement of lot grading, and ensuring appropriate transition to neighboring lots. 7267244.\n",

(Directors: Yan Zhao, Fuhua Yuan and Man Yuan) for permission to develop 25 townhouse units at 9200, 9220, 9240, 9260, 9280, 9300, 9320, 9340 Francis Road. The site is being rezoned from \"Single Detached (RS 1/E)\" to \"Town Housing (ZT94) Francis Road (Broadmoor)\" for this project under Bylaw 10254 (RZ 20-907463), which received third reading following the Public Hearing on July 19, 2021. The site currently contains eight single-family homes, which will be demolished.\nHighlights of the proposed development include:\n- 25 townhouse units, including 13 three-storey units in three townhouse clusters along Francis Road and 12 two-storey duplex style units in six townhouse clusters along the rear property line.\n- Three of the two-storey units are designed in accordance with the convertible unit guidelines.\n- Nine existing bylaw-sized trees will be retained on-site, including three trees in the proposed outdoor amenity area and six trees within the rear yards.\nA Servicing Agreement is required as a condition of Building Permit issuance and includes, but is not limited to, the following improvements:\n- Removal of the existing sidewalk and replacement with 2.0 m concrete sidewalk at the property line, 1.5 m landscaped boulevard, and 0.15 m concrete curb and gutter.\n- Replace approximately 150 m long existing watermain along the Francis Road frontage.\n- Replace approximately 150 m long AC sanitary main along the entire south property line, complete with new manholes per City spacing requirements.\nDevelopment Information\nPlease refer to attached Development Application Data Sheet (Attachment 1) for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements.\nBackground\nDevelopment surrounding the subject site is as follows:\nTo the north: Across Francis Road, single detached dwellings on properties zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/C)\" and townhouse dwellings on a property zoned \"Low Density Townhouses (RTLl).\"\nTo the south: Single detached and duplex dwellings on properties fronting Glenbrook Drive zoned \"Single Detached (RSl/E).\"\nTo the east and west: Single detached dwellings on properties zoned \"Single Detached (RS 1/E),\" which are designated \"Arterial Road Townhouse\" in the Arterial Road Land Use Policy.\nRezoning and Public Hearing Results\nThe Public Hearing for the rezoning of this site was held on July 19, 2021. At the Public Hearing, concerns were expressed about increased traffic, construction impacts, and neighboring fences. The applicant's responses to these concerns were provided. Additionally, a cyclist inquired about cycling infrastructure improvements along Francis Road as part of the development permit application. The suggestions and staff's responses were provided.\n1. Increased traffic: A Traffic and Parking Assessment Report concludes that the proposed 25-unit townhouse development will have very minor impact on the traffic operations of the future road network, and no traffic or parking issues are expected.\n2. Construction impacts: Construction will follow City and other governmental regulations and guidelines, and negative impacts will be prevented or minimized. A Construction Traffic and Parking Management Plan will be required prior to building permit issuance to mitigate impacts of heavy truck traffic during construction.\n3. Neighboring fences: All existing fences on neighboring properties will be maintained, and a new fence will be installed on-site abutting the existing fences.\nThe implementation of cycling facilities in the City is guided by the Cycling Network Plan, which was developed based on extensive stakeholder and public engagements. The section of Francis Road falls outside of the 15-year priority list in the plan. All townhouse developments are required to provide on-site off-street car parking facilities for residents and visitors.\n\n",

Windows are proposed on the west and east elevations for light penetration and surveillance of the lane.\n\nUrban Design and Site Planning:\n- The primary pedestrian entry to the coach house is from the rear lane, with secondary pedestrian access from Dennis Crescent along the north side of the property.\n- The east elevation of the coach house facing the lane is designed as the primary facade, with a bay window, front entry, and exterior lighting to enhance visibility and appearance of the lane.\n- Private outdoor space for the coach house is proposed off the west side, accessible from the rear or front door.\n- A shared garbage and recycling enclosure is proposed, adequately sized and screened by wood fencing, gates, and landscaping.\n- The site plan provides on-site parking, including two spaces for the principal dwelling in the garage off the lane and one permeable parking space for the coach house with lane access.\n\nArchitectural Form and Character:\n- The proposed exterior building materials and colors of the coach house are consistent with the neighborhood, including taupe Hardie-plank siding, taupe stucco with grey trim, cedar, and black stone accents.\n- The primary facade of the coach house facing the lane is visually broken into smaller components with a projecting bay window on the lower floor and various windows on the upper floor.\n\nLandscape Design and Open Space Design:\n- There are no on-site trees in the area of the proposed coach house and garage. Tree retention and removal will be assessed and reviewed when applying for a building permit for the single-family dwelling.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further information.\n\nWayne Craig\nDirector, Development\n604-247-4625\nWC:le\n7342153\nSeptember 5, 2023\n",

The site is currently vacant and is zoned as \"High Rise Apartment (ZHR8) Brighouse Village (City Centre)\". \n\nZoning: The site is zoned as \"High Rise Apartment (ZHR8) Brighouse Village (City Centre)\". Zoning Bylaw 8500, Amendment Bylaw 8738 (RZ 09-506908), and associated Development Permit (DP 09-506909) were approved in 2012, but the development did not proceed. A new Development Permit (DP 17-791045) was issued in 2022, and due to design changes, a new Development Permit (DP 22-023105) is required. \n\nServicing Agreement: An associated Servicing Agreement (SA 19-858294) is under staff review and will be required for the issuance of this Development Permit. Updated design drawings and a new Letter of Credit security are also required. The Servicing Agreement includes the design and construction of a new City lane, Cooney Road frontage improvements, and sanitary sewer improvements. \n\nDevelopment Information: Please refer to the attached Development Application Data Sheet for a comparison of the proposed development data with the relevant Bylaw requirements. \n\nBackground: Surrounding the subject site are a 14-storey residential tower to the north, a three-storey townhouse development across Cooney Road to the east, a one-storey single detached house across a proposed lane to the south, and two four-storey wood frame apartment buildings to the west. \n\nStaff Comments: The proposed development complies with urban design issues, staff comments, and the Official Community Plan. It is generally in compliance with the \"High Rise Apartment (ZHR8) Brighouse Village (City Centre)\" zone. \n\nAdvisory Design Panel Comments: The Advisory Design Panel supports the application, subject to their comments. \n\nAnalysis: The development is located at the southeast corner of the site to maximize distance from neighboring residential development. Landscape buffers and design features are included to provide separation and visual interest. The development will be accessed from a new City lane, and the site is located within an Aircraft Noise Policy area. \n\nUrban Design and Site Planning: The proposed development takes advantage of the site's proximity to the Canada Line and the new City lane. Access to the site will be from the new lane, and service uses will be screened from public view.\n",

The site is currently designated as an Environmentally Sensitive Area, requiring an ESA Development Permit.\n\nThe proposed project footprint is 23.9 ha, with 20.96 ha situated within the designated ESA. In compensation for disturbing 21 ha of ESA, GVS&DD has committed to planting and rehabilitating 26.2 ha of the island.\n\nPrevious ESA Development Permits have been issued for this site, allowing for the expansion of the wastewater treatment plant and construction of related facilities. The proposed project includes the development of previously secured ESA compensation areas.\n\nDevelopment Information: The subject site is currently occupied by buildings and structures associated with the existing wastewater treatment plant.\n\nDevelopment surrounding the site includes the North Arm of the Fraser River to the north, Iona Beach Regional Park to the east, Iona Island causeway to the south, and Iona Beach and North Arm Jetty to the west.\n\nStaff Comments: The proposed scheme addresses ESA issues and complies with the Official Community Plan and zoning requirements. No variances are being sought.\n\nAdvisory Design Panel Comments: The Advisory Design Panel has not reviewed the application as it does not involve building design components.\n\nAnalysis: The IIWWTP currently provides primary sewage treatment through sludge removal and anaerobic digestion. The proposed upgrades will enhance the treatment process.\n\nSite Planning: The proposed project will incorporate secondary and tertiary treatment facilities into the existing wastewater treatment plant.\n",

Reduce the minimum required rear yard setback for a portion of the second storey from 10.70 m to 10.64 m at 7151 Bridge Street to retain an existing second-storey deck.\n   2. Reduce the minimum required rear yard setback for accessory buildings with a wall length greater than 6.0 m from 2.4 m to 2.08 m at 7211 Bridge Street to retain an existing detached garage.\n   3. Reduce the minimum required rear yard setback for 60% of the first storey from 9.60 m to 7.4 m, as well as the remaining 40% of the first storey and the second storey from 10.70 m to 8.0 m at 7231 Bridge Street to retain an existing dwelling. Also, reduce the minimum required rear yard setback for a portion of the second storey from 10.7 m to 6.8 m to retain an existing second-storey deck.\n   4. Reduce the minimum required rear yard setback for 60% of the first storey from 9.60 m to 7.02 m, as well as the remaining 40% of the first storey and the second storey from 10.70 m to 7.02 m at 7251 Bridge Street to retain an existing dwelling.\n\nBackground:\n- Khalid Hassan has applied on behalf of the owners for permission to reduce the minimum rear yard setback requirements for four properties in a proposed 16 lot subdivision.\n- The properties were part of a rezoning application adopted by City Council on December 21, 2022.\n- The rezoning application aims to create six lots fronting Bridge Street and ten lots fronting an extension to Armstrong Street while retaining the existing homes on Bridge Street.\n- Variances to the rear yard setback provisions are required for four of the lots on Bridge Street.\n\nDevelopment Information:\n- The subject properties are part of a rezoning application to create 16 single-family lots.\n- The proposed variances are necessary to retain the existing structures on four of the lots.\n- If the variances are not approved, the existing structures would need to be modified or removed before subdivision approval.\n\nAnalysis:\n- The applicant requests variances to reduce the minimum rear yard setbacks for various reasons.\n- Staff supports the proposed variances because they do not facilitate new construction and only permit the retention of existing houses in good condition.\n- Any new construction would still need to comply with the minimum setback requirements of Zoning Bylaw 8500.\n- The retention of existing single-family homes was identified during the rezoning application.\n- The proposed setback variances do not affect the tree retention secured through the rezoning process or the applicant's commitment to provide new trees on-site.\n- The adjacent properties to the west, created upon subdivision, will be owned by the applicant.\n",

This includes upgrades to the on-site landscaping and the existing garbage and recycling enclosure on a site zoned \"Auto-Oriented Commercial (CA)\".\n\nDevelopment Information\nThis Development Permit only applies to the portion of the building that contains the existing McDonald's restaurant (Unit 115) and immediate surrounding on-site landscaping and vehicle circulation areas. No rezoning application is required, and no servicing or infrastructure works are needed.\n\nBackground\nThe existing McDonald's restaurant is a one-storey building with a drive-through service component. The proposed modifications will only be made to the McDonald's restaurant and not the neighboring commercial retail unit. The site is part of a commercial complex with other businesses and off-street parking.\n\nDevelopment surrounding the subject site:\n- To the north: a business park zoned \"Industrial Business Park (IB 1)\"\n- To the east: an access road and a one-storey commercial building on a site zoned \"Auto-Oriented Commercial (CA)\"\n- To the south: Highway 99 and an existing hotel on a site zoned \"Auto-Oriented Commercial (CA)\"\n- To the west: Highway 99 and the off-ramp for the Cambie Road overpass\n\nStaff Comments\nThe proposed scheme satisfactorily addresses urban design issues and staff comments. It complies with the Official Community Plan and the \"Auto-Oriented Commercial (CA)\" zone.\n\nAdvisory Design Panel Comments\nDue to the minor nature of the renovations, the application was not presented to the Advisory Design Panel.\n\nAnalysis\nConditions of Adjacency:\n- Modifications to the on-site enclosure for garbage, recycling, and organic waste are being undertaken. The enclosure will be fully enclosed and screened from the sidewalk.\n- No modifications to the building's mechanical systems are required.\n- Existing rooftop mechanical units will be screened.\n- Drive-through operations audio/speaker box system is oriented to minimize impacts and adjust volume based on ambient noise conditions.\n- No acoustical study was required.\n\nUrban Design and Site Planning:\n- The modifications are primarily limited to the building exterior, existing landscape areas, and service area.\n- Off-street parking, vehicle circulation, and drive-through servicing will generally remain unchanged.\n- Additional modifications include parking stall curb stops, pavement markings, maintaining pedestrian linkage, and implementing additional signage.\n- The drive-through configuration will be maintained.\n- The surrounding off-street parking provides for 25 vehicle parking stalls, complying with requirements.\n",

    "text": "To: City of Richmond Development Permit Panel\nFrom: Wayne Craig, Director of Development\nDate: November 6, 2023\nFile: DP 21-944169\n\nStaff Recommendation: Issue a Development Permit at 11191 Twigg Place for the installation of a barge loading facility on an Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) site.\n\nBackground: Weaver Technical Corp. has applied for a Development Permit to build a barge ramp at 11191 Twigg Place. The site is currently zoned as \"Industrial (I)\" and is used for truck and industrial equipment storage. There are no permanent structures on the site, except for two shipping containers used as an office space. The proposed barge ramp would be located within the ESA portion of the site.\n\nStaff Comments: The proposed barge ramp would impact the ESA designated areas on the site. While industrial uses are allowed without a Development Permit, the installation of a barge loading facility within the ESA requires an ESA Development Permit. The proposed scheme addresses environmental concerns and complies with the Official Community Plan and the \"Industrial (I)\" zone.\n\nAnalysis: The owner plans to construct a barge ramp in the water lot in front of the site for transporting aggregate materials. No aggregate materials would be stored on-site. The water lot is currently leased and used for log storage. The owner has entered into a memorandum of understanding with the leaseholder and has submitted a crown land lease application to the Province for the change in water lot use. Access to the ramp would be provided via a truck staging area and a drive aisle on the site. The development would not include any additional buildings or structures beyond the barge ramp. The existing office operation in the shipping containers would remain. The site would be raised to prepare for future dike improvements and climate change effects, with lock block walls installed along the property lines. Truck traffic would access the barges via the raised surface.\n\nSenior Governmental Approvals: The proposed barge ramp facility requires approvals from multiple regulatory agencies in addition to the City of Richmond.\n",

The rezoning of the site to the \"Medium Density Townhouse (RTM2)\" zone was approved by Council on October 12, 2021. The Development Permit (DP 18-829236) was also issued on October 12, 2021. The development is nearing completion with interior finishing work in progress and landscaping work remaining.\n\nStaff Comments: The proposed modification to the Tree Management Plan and Landscape Plan is to address the deterioration and irreversible decline of a tree (Tree Tag #726) that was supposed to be retained. The proposed changes do not impact any works associated with the Servicing Agreement.\n\nSummary of Tree Protection and Replacement Plan:\n- Ten trees were identified to be retained and protected, with this report specifically addressing Tree 726.\n- The south side yard setback at the southwest corner of the site was increased to 7.56 m to retain the Sycamore maple tree (Tree 726).\n- Tree protection fencing was installed around all retained trees prior to construction activities.\n- A Tree Management Plan and Landscape Plan were issued with the Development Permit.\n- The applicant agreed to plant 62 new trees on-site, including 13 conifers and 49 deciduous trees.\n\nAnalysis: Tree 726 has shown signs of decline since June 2022 and is in an advanced state of irreversible decline, according to the Project Arborist's findings. The City's Tree Preservation staff have reviewed and agreed with these findings.\n\nNote: Attachments 1-5 provide additional details and plans related to the General Compliance ruling.\n\nWayne Craig\nDirector, Development\n",

A location map and aerial photo are provided in Attachment 1. The proposed subdivision plan and draft site plan are provided in Attachment 2.\n\nFindings of Fact\nA Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 3).\n\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile\nThe subject site contains an existing un-stratified non-conforming duplex (two-unit dwelling), which will be demolished prior to subdivision. Both dwelling units are currently tenant occupied and do not contain any secondary suites. The applicant has indicated that the tenants are aware of the redevelopment proposal and the applicant will ensure compliance with the Residential Tenancy Act.\n\nSurrounding Development\nDevelopment immediately surrounding the site is as follows:\nTo the North: A single-family houses on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”.\nTo the South: A single-family houses on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”.\nTo the East: Across the lane, an existing duplex on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)” fronting onto No. 5 Road. There is a Rezoning application and Development Permit (RZ 22-019002/DP 23-028942) at 10111/10113 No. 5 Road to permit the development of three front-back duplex lots. The rezoning application received third reading on October 16, 2023.\nTo the West: Across Seabrook Crescent, an existing duplex on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”.\n\nRelated Policies & Studies\nOfficial Community Plan\nThe subject site is designated as “Neighbourhood Residential” in the Official Community Plan (OCP).

The Policy permits a majority of lots within the Policy Area (including the subject property) to be rezoned and subdivided in accordance with the provisions of the “Single Detached (RS1/E)” zone.\n\nThe subject site is currently occupied by a legal duplex. Section 2.3.7 of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 provides that the Lot Size Policy does not apply to a rezoning that a legal duplex and which are intended to be subdivided into no more than two single-family lots. The proposed rezoning and subdivision complies with Section 2.3.7 and would result in the creation of two single-family lots being 444.9 m2 and 450.2 m2 in area. Further, the proposed rezoning and subdivision would comply with the minimum lot dimensions and size applicable to the “Single Detached (RS2B)” zone.\n\nMinistry of Transportation & Infrastructure Approval\nAs the subject site is located within 800 m of an intersection of a Provincial Limited Access Highway and a City road, this redevelopment proposal was referred to the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MOTI) for review and comment. Preliminary confirmation has been received from MOTI indicating that they have no objections to the proposed redevelopment. Final approval from MOTI is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\n\nFloodplain Management Implementation Strategy\nThe proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\n\nPublic Consultation\nA rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have not received any comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the placement of the rezoning sign on the property.\n\nShould the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the bylaw will be forwarded to a Public Hearing, where any area resident or interested party will have an opportunity to comment.\n\nPublic notification for the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City’s Zoning Bylaw 8500.\n\nPLN - 41\n",

The applicant has been advised that encroachment into the SRW is not permitted. A City Covenant is registered on both 10840 and 10860 Bonavista Gate Titles that restrict the development to a duplex, therefore, the duplex covenants must be discharged from Title prior to the final adoption of the rezoning bylaw. There is a Land Tax Deferment Act Agreement currently registered on the 10840 Bonavista Gate Title (proposed Lot A), which allows the property owner to defer the payment of taxes. All deferred taxes must be paid and the agreement must be discharged from Title prior to the preparation and registration of any legal documents associated with this rezoning application.\n\nTransportation and Site Access: Vehicle access is proposed to be from Bonavista Gate for both of the proposed lots.

The proposal for four three-storey townhouse units and one secondary suite is also generally consistent with the surrounding developments.\n\nFloodplain Management Implementation Strategy\nThe proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\n\nPublic Consultation\nA rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have not yet received any comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the rezoning sign on site.\n\nShould the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the public will have an opportunity to further comment on all of the proposed amendments at a Public Hearing.\n\nPublic notification of the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City's Zoning Bylaw 8500.\n\nAnalysis\nBuilt Form and Architectural Character\nThe applicant proposes to construct a total of four townhouse units and one secondary suite with access from St. Albans Road. The layout of the townhouse units is oriented around a single driveway providing access to the site from St. Albans Road and a north-south internal maneuvering aisle providing access to the unit garages. A total of two three-storey duplex clusters are proposed.\n\nPH - 7\n",

(Directors: Amar Gill and Jasdeep Uppal) have applied to the City of Richmond for permission to rezone 10511 Lassam Road from the \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\" zone to the \"Single Detached (RS2/B)\" zone, to permit the property to be subdivided to create two single-family lots with access from Lassam Road. A map and aerial photograph showing the location of the subject site is included in Attachment 1. The proposed subdivision is provided in Attachment 2.\nFindings of Fact: A Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 3).\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile: There is an existing single-family dwelling on the subject property which is currently vacant and proposed to be demolished. There are no existing secondary suites in the dwelling.\nSurrounding Development: Development immediately surrounding the subject site is as follows:\nTo the North: A school (James McKinney Elementary School) on a lot zoned \"School & Institutional Use (SI)\", accessed from Lassam Road.\nTo the South: A single-family dwelling on a property zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/B)\", accessed from Lassam Road.\nTo the East: Across Lassam Road, single-family dwellings on lots zoned \"Single Detached (RS1/E)\", accessed from Lassam Road.\nTo the West: The parking area for a school (James McKinney Elementary School) on a lot zoned \"School & Institutional Use (SI)\", accessed from Lassam Road.\nRelated Policies & Studies\nOfficial Community Plan/Steveston Planning Area: The subject property is located in the Steveston planning area and is designated as \"Neighbourhood Residential\" in the Official Community Plan (OCP). The property is designated for \"Single Family\" use in the Steveston Area Plan. The proposed rezoning and subdivision are consistent with these designations.\nPLN - 8\nNovember 6, 2023\n- 3 -\nRZ 22-011080\n7404492\nSingle Family Lot Size Policy 5420/Zoning Bylaw 8500: The subject property is located within the area covered by Lot Size Policy 5420, adopted by City Council in 1989, and subsequently amended by Council on August 7, 1992, and on August 21, 1995 (Attachment 4). The Policy permits properties along Lassam Road to be rezoned and subdivided in accordance with the provisions of the \"Single Detached (RS2/B)\" zone (minimum 12 m wide lots). Each proposed lot at the subject site will be approximately 12.6 m (41 ft.) wide and approximately 575 m² (6,189.25 ft²) in area which conforms to the RS2/B zone. The proposed rezoning complies with the Lot Size Policy.\nFloodplain Management Implementation Strategy: The proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\nPublic Consultation: In accordance with the City's Early Public Notification Policy No. 1316, a notice of the development proposal was provided to residents within 100 metres of the subject site. In addition, a rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have not received any comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the early public notification or placement of the rezoning sign on the property. Should the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the bylaw will be forwarded to a Public Hearing, where any area resident or interested party will have an opportunity to comment. Public notification for the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City's Zoning Bylaw 8500.\nAnalysis: This redevelopment proposes to rezone and subdivide an existing single-family lot into two new single-family lots with vehicular access for both new lots off Lassam Road. This rezoning and subdivision is consistent with the emerging lot fabric and vehicular access along Lassam Road.\nExisting Legal Encumbrances: There is an existing 3 m wide Statutory Right-of-Way (SRW) for City sanitary service that covers a small portion of the property in the southwest corner which will be expanded and widened northward with utility upgrades. The applicant has been advised that no building encroachment into the SRW is permitted.\nTransportation and Site Access: The subject site currently has vehicular access from a driveway letdown along Lassam Road. In accordance with the Residential Lot (Vehicular) Access Regulation Bylaw 7222, vehicle access to proposed Lot 1 and proposed Lot 2 will be from Lassam Road.\nPLN - 9\n",

Site and Context\nThe subject site is located at the southeast corner of Lord Street and West 65th Avenue. It consists of a six-lot assembly with six single-detached houses. The total site area is 3,080.0 sq. m. The Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy applies to the application.\n2. Policy Context\nThe Vancouver Plan, Cambie Corridor Plan, Cambie Corridor Public Realm Plan, Marpole Community Plan, Housing Needs Report, Housing Vancouver Strategy, and various other policies and by-laws are relevant to this application.\nThe City approved a Plan for the next 30 years, which will be implemented over the next two to four years. The site is located within the Cambie Corridor Plan area, which is aligned with the Vancouver Plan. The Cambie Corridor Plan allows for rezoning for a residential building up to six storeys with a floor space ratio (FSR) up to 2.5. An additional partial floor is permitted for common amenity space. \n\nOn April 27, 2022, Council received a Housing Needs Report (HNR) prepared by staff. The Council must consider the most recent HNR when developing or amending a development plan related to affordable housing, rental housing, and special needs housing. The proposed zoning amendment would facilitate the delivery of secured rental housing, including below-market rental units, and address the data and findings within the HNR.\n\nThe rezoning proposal is for two six-storey residential buildings with 146 secured-market units.\n",

Ltd. (Balraj Singh Sanghera and Rajbir Kaur Chatha), to rezone 11831/11833 Seabrook Crescent from the “Single Detached (RS1/E)” zone to the “Single Detached (RS2/B)” zone in order to permit the property to be subdivided into two single-family lots, each with vehicle access from Seabrook Crescent. A location map and aerial photo are provided in Attachment 1. The proposed subdivision plan and draft site plan are provided in Attachment 2.\nFindings of Fact\nA Development Application Data Sheet providing details about the development proposal is attached (Attachment 3).\nSubject Site Existing Housing Profile\nThe subject site contains an existing un-stratified non-conforming duplex (two-unit dwelling), which will be demolished prior to subdivision. Both dwelling units are currently tenant occupied and do not contain any secondary suites. The applicant has indicated that the tenants are aware of the redevelopment proposal and the applicant will ensure compliance with the Residential Tenancy Act.\nSurrounding Development\nDevelopment immediately surrounding the site is as follows:\nTo the North: A single-family houses on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”.\nTo the South: A single-family houses on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”.\nTo the East: Across the lane, an existing duplex on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)” fronting onto No. 5 Road. There is a Rezoning application and Development Permit (RZ 22-019002/DP 23-028942) at 10111/10113 No. 5 Road to permit the development of three front-back duplex lots. The rezoning application received third reading on October 16, 2023.\nTo the West: Across Seabrook Crescent, an existing duplex on a lot zoned “Single Detached (RS1/E)”.\nRelated Policies & Studies\nOfficial Community Plan\nThe subject site is designated as “Neighbourhood Residential” in the Official Community Plan (OCP). This proposal is consistent with this OCP designation.\nPH - 38\nOctober 23, 2023\n- 3 -\nRZ 22-010976\n7409688\nSingle-Family Lot Size Policy 5434/ Zoning Bylaw 8500\nThe subject property is located within the area covered by Lot Size Policy 5434, adopted by City Council in 1990, amended in 1991 and 2006 (Attachment 4). The Policy permits a majority of lots within the Policy Area (including the subject property) to be rezoned and subdivided in accordance with the provisions of the “Single Detached (RS1/E)” zone.\nThe subject site is currently occupied by a legal duplex. Section 2.3.7 of Richmond Zoning Bylaw 8500 provides that the Lot Size Policy does not apply to a rezoning that a legal duplex and which are intended to be subdivided into no more than two single-family lots. The proposed rezoning and subdivision complies with Section 2.3.7 and would result in the creation of two single-family lots being 444.9 m2 and 450.2 m2 in area. Further, the proposed rezoning and subdivision would comply with the minimum lot dimensions and size applicable to the “Single Detached (RS2B)” zone.\nMinistry of Transportation & Infrastructure Approval\nAs the subject site is located within 800 m of an intersection of a Provincial Limited Access Highway and a City road, this redevelopment proposal was referred to the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MOTI) for review and comment. Preliminary confirmation has been received from MOTI indicating that they have no objections to the proposed redevelopment. Final approval from MOTI is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\nFloodplain Management Implementation Strategy\nThe proposed redevelopment must meet the requirements of the Richmond Flood Plain Designation and Protection Bylaw 8204. Registration of a flood indemnity covenant on Title is required prior to final adoption of the rezoning bylaw.\nPublic Consultation\nA rezoning sign has been installed on the subject property. Staff have not received any comments from the public about the rezoning application in response to the placement of the rezoning sign on the property.\nShould the Planning Committee endorse this application and Council grant first reading to the rezoning bylaw, the bylaw will be forwarded to a Public Hearing, where any area resident or interested party will have an opportunity to comment.\nPublic notification for the Public Hearing will be provided as per the Local Government Act and the City’s Zoning Bylaw 8500.\nPH - 39\n",
